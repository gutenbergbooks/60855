<h2 id="c1">Preface</h2>
<p>It is hard to fix a beginning date for the Westward Movement, unless
we start with 1492 and Columbus&rsquo; first voyage of discovery. In reality the
entire history of the New World is a movement of Europeans to the Western
Hemisphere. In earlier booklets in this series we have dealt with the
migrations of pioneers from the Atlantic Coast to the land beyond the
Appalachian Mountains. We also have covered the expedition of Lewis
and Clark to the Pacific Coast in 1805 and the annexation of Texas in
1845. This booklet is primarily concerned with the region beyond the Midwest,
the high plains, the Rocky Mountains, the Sierra Nevadas, the deserts,
and the fertile Pacific Coast.</p>
<p>Restlessness and mobility have always been distinguishing characteristics
of the American people. Revolutionary War veterans settled in Ohio
or Kentucky and lived to see their children move on to Missouri or Texas.
Their children&rsquo;s children pushed farther west to the Pacific Coast over the
Oregon Trail or sailed around Cape Horn to join the gold rush in California.
The westward movement still goes on, as a glance at the latest
census report will quickly show. The difference is that nowadays the immigrant
can arrive in California in a few hours by jet from New York, pan his
gold on the assembly line of a company making guided missiles, and sleep
in a cabin with a barbecue grill and a swimming pool in the back yard.</p>
<p>This booklet begins with descriptions of the land and the people in the
Great West before the Civil War. This was a period of exploration and
conquest. Until they saw for themselves, people could not believe the
plains were as broad, the deserts as hot and dry, and the mountains as
rugged and high as they really were. Every day was an adventure, some
of which ended disastrously. But the West was conquered and the continent
spanned by trail, by stagecoach route, and finally by railroad.</p>
<p>When one speaks of the frontier, he must keep in mind that there was
more than one frontier as the West filled up. There was, first of all, the
frontier of the explorer and trapper. These men had no more effect on
the land than the Indians who had roamed the mountains and plains for
thousands of years. Next, there was the mining frontier, which brought
mushroom growth to specific areas like central California or Denver,
Colorado, but left untouched the vast areas in between. Then there was
the ranching frontier which created cow towns and cattle trails. Finally,
<span class="pb" id="Page_vi">vi</span>
there was the farming frontier, which changed the face of the land unalterably
and filled the gaps left by the miners and ranchers.</p>
<p>The frontier of the trappers and explorers ended with the discoveries
of gold and silver and the expansion of the borders of the United States
all the way to the Pacific Coast. The frontier of the miner and the rancher
ended with the building of the transcontinental railroad, which opened up
the West to farmers. The frontier of the farmer ended when the entire
West was more or less fenced in and dotted with settlements. The closing
of the frontier was dramatically announced in 1890 by the director of the
census, who reported that no longer could a line be drawn on the map
showing the farthest point reached by settlements.</p>
<p>This booklet illustrates the various frontiers from the plains to the
Pacific. The West has stimulated the American imagination as almost no
other aspect of our history (the television fare on any average night proves
this); hence the total literature on the subject is vast. We have selected a
handful of interesting reports from the many available.</p>
<p>In editing the manuscripts in this booklet, we have followed the practice
of modernizing punctuation, capitalization, and spelling only when necessary
to make the selections clear. We have silently corrected misspelled
words and typographical errors. Whenever possible we have used complete
selections, but occasionally space limitations made necessary cuts
in the original documents. Such cuts are indicated by spaced periods. In
general, the selections appear as the authors wrote them.</p>

<h2 id="c2">Fr&eacute;mont Crosses the Sierras</h2>
<p>Col. John Fr&eacute;mont led several exploring expeditions into the Oregon
Territory, mapped the Oregon Trail, and helped add California to the
United States during the Mexican War. He later was one of California&rsquo;s
first United States Senators and the first presidential candidate of the Republican
Party. In 1844 we find him at the head of an expedition exploring
the Sierra Nevada Mountains. In the account that follows, Fr&eacute;mont describes
crossing the snowy range in February, over what is now Carson
Pass and descending along the approximate route of U. S. Highway 50
to Sacramento.</p>
<h3 id="c3">Colonel John Fr&eacute;mont Describes His Expedition</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>2d.&mdash;It had ceased snowing, and this morning the lower air was
clear and frosty; and six or seven thousand feet above, the peaks of
the Sierra now and then appeared among the rolling clouds, which
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">2</span>
were rapidly dispersing before the sun. Our Indian shook his head
as he pointed to the icy pinnacles, shooting high up into the sky,
and seeming almost immediately above us. Crossing the river on the
ice, and leaving it immediately, we commenced the ascent of the
mountain along the valley of a tributary stream. The people were
unusually silent, for every man knew that our enterprise was hazardous,
and the issue doubtful.</p>
<p>The snow deepened rapidly, and it soon became necessary to
break a road. For this service, a party of ten was formed, mounted
on the strongest horses, each man in succession opening the road on
foot, or on horseback, until himself and his horse became fatigued,
when he stepped aside, and, the remaining number passing ahead,
he took his station in the rear. Leaving this stream, and pursuing a
very direct course, we passed over an intervening ridge to the river
we had left....</p>
<p>The nut-pines were now giving way to heavy timber, and there
were some immense pines on the bottom, around the roots of which
the sun had melted away the snow; and here we made our camp and
built huge fires. Today we had traveled 16 miles, and our elevation
above the sea was 6,760 feet.</p>
<p>3d.&mdash;Turning our faces directly towards the main chain, we
ascended an open hollow along a small tributary to the river which,
according to the Indians, issues from a mountain to the south. The
snow was so deep in the hollow, that we were obliged to travel along
the steep hillsides, and over spurs, where the wind and sun had in
places lessened the snow, and where the grass, which appeared to
be in good quality along the sides of the mountains, was exposed.
We opened our road in the same way as yesterday, but made only
seven miles, and encamped by some springs at the foot of a high
and steep hill, by which the hollow ascended to another basin in
the mountain. The little stream below was entirely buried in
snow....</p>
<p>4th&mdash;I went ahead early with two or three men, each with a lead
horse to break the road. We were obliged to abandon the hollow entirely
and work along the mountainside, which was very steep, and
the snow covered with an icy crust. We cut a footing as we advanced
and trampled a road through for the animals; but occasionally one
plunged outside the trail, and slid along the field to the bottom, a
<span class="pb" id="Page_3">3</span>
hundred yards below. Late in the day we reached another bench in
the hollow, where in summer the stream passed over a small precipice.
Here was a short distance of dividing ground between the two
ridges, and beyond an open basin, some ten miles across, whose
bottom presented a field of snow. At the further or western side rose
the middle crest of the mountain, a dark-looking ridge of volcanic
rock.</p>
<p>The summit line presented a range of naked peaks, apparently
destitute of snow and vegetation; but below, the face of the whole
country was covered with timber of extraordinary size.</p>
<p>Towards a pass which the guide indicated here, we attempted in
the afternoon to force a road; but after a laborious plunging through
two or three hundred yards, our best horses gave out, entirely refusing
to make any further effort, and, for the time, we were brought
to a stand. The guide informed us that we were entering the deep
snow, and here began the difficulties of the mountain; and to him,
and almost to all, our enterprise seemed hopeless....</p>
<p>5th&mdash;The night had been too cold to sleep, and we were up
very early. Our guide was standing by the fire with all his finery on;
and seeing him shiver in the cold, I threw on his shoulders one of
my blankets. We missed him a few minutes afterwards, and never
saw him again. He had deserted....</p>
<p>While a portion of the camp were occupied in bringing up the
baggage to this point, the remainder were busied in making sledges
and snowshoes. I had determined to explore the mountain ahead,
and the sledges were to be used in transporting the baggage....</p>
<p>6th&mdash;Accompanied by Mr. Fitzpatrick, I set out today with a
reconnoitering party on snowshoes. We marched all in single file,
trampling the snow as heavily as we could. Crossing the open basin
in a march of about ten miles, we reached the top of one of the peaks,
to the left of the pass indicated by our guide. Far below us, dimmed
by the distance, was a large snowless valley, bounded on the western
side, at the distance of about a hundred miles, by a low range of
mountains which [<i>Kit</i>] Carson recognized with delight as the mountains
bordering the coast. &ldquo;There,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;is the little mountain&mdash;it
is fifteen years since I saw it; but I am just as sure as if I had seen
it yesterday.&rdquo; Between us, then, and this low coast range, was the
valley of the Sacramento.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">4</div>
<p>Fr&eacute;mont and his companions retraced their steps to camp and spent
the next four days preparing for the final ascent to the pass. The temperature
was three below zero on the eighth, and on the ninth snow fell. They
then were camped at 8,000 feet.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>11th&mdash;High wind continued, and our trail this morning was
nearly invisible&mdash;here and there indicated by a little ridge of snow.
Our situation became tiresome and dreary, requiring a strong exercise
of patience and resolution.</p>
<p>In the evening I received a message from Mr. Fitzpatrick, acquainting
me with the utter failure of his attempt to get our mules
and horses over the snow&mdash;the half-hidden trail had proved entirely
too slight to support them, and they had broken through, and were
plunging about or lying half buried in snow. He was occupied in
endeavoring to get them back to his camp; and in the meantime sent
to me for further instructions. I wrote to him to send the animals
immediately back to their old pastures; and, after having made
mauls and shovels, turn in all the strength of his party to open and
beat a road through the snow, strengthening it with branches and
boughs of the pines.</p>
<p>12th&mdash;We made mauls, and worked hard at our end of the road
all day. The wind was high, but the sun bright, and the snow thawing.
We worked down the face of the hill, to meet the people at the other
end. Towards sundown it began to grow cold, and we shouldered our
mauls and trudged back to camp....</p>
<p>14th&mdash;the dividing ridge of the Sierra is in sight from this encampment....</p>
<p>16th&mdash;We had succeeded in getting our animals safely to the
first grassy hill; and this morning I started with Jacob on a reconnoitering
expedition beyond the mountain. We traveled along the
crests of narrow ridges, extending down from the mountain in the
direction of the valley, from which the snow was fast melting away.
On the open spots was tolerably good grass; and I judged we should
succeed in getting the camp down by way of these. Towards sundown
we discovered some icy spots in a deep hollow; and, descending
the mountain, we encamped on the headwater of a little creek,
where at last the water found its way to the Pacific....</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<p>I was now perfectly satisfied that we had struck the stream on
which Mr. Sutter lived; and turning about, made a hard push, and
reached the camp at dark. Here we had the pleasure to find all the
remaining animals, 57 in number, safely arrived at the grassy hill
near the camp....</p>
<p>On the 19th, the people were occupied in making a road and
bringing up the baggage; and, on the afternoon of the next day,
<i>February 20, 1844</i>, we encamped, with the animals and all the
<i>mat&eacute;riel</i> of the camp, on the summit of the PASS [<i>Carson Pass,
altitude, 8,635 ft.</i>] in the dividing ridge.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The expedition then began the descent towards the Sacramento River
Valley, which was just as hard as the climb. By the time they reached lower
altitudes, where they found grass for their horses and mules and game and
fish for themselves, they were nearly exhausted and their animals almost
starved. But the journey ended successfully, and the expedition reached
Sutter&rsquo;s ranch on the American River on March 6.</p>
<h2 id="c4">The Desert Barrier</h2>
<h3 id="c5">Sarah Royce Crosses the Desert</h3>
<p>It is hard today to realize the terrors that the desert held for settlers
who toiled across the empty wastes by covered wagon in 1849. The trip,
which now takes only a few hours by auto, then required days of courage
and endurance, plus careful preparation. In the following narrative Sarah
Royce, mother of the philosopher Josiah Royce, tells of her experiences in
crossing the desert from Salt Lake City to the California gold fields. She
was traveling in a single wagon with her two-year-old daughter, her husband,
and several other men when the party lost its way. They had started
before daylight and missed a turn which led to a grassy meadow and
water. Hence they found themselves at noon far out on the desert, lacking
fodder for the oxen and water.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We began to look anxiously for the depression in the ground,
and the holes dug, which we were told would mark the Sink of the
Humboldt. But it was nearly noonday before we came to them.
There was still some passable water in the holes, but not fit to drink
clear, so we contrived to gather enough sticks of sage to boil some,
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
made a little coffee, ate our lunch and, thus refreshed, we hastened
to find the forking road. Our director had told us, that within about
two or three miles beyond the Sink we might look for the road, to
the left, and we did look, and kept looking, and going on, drearily,
till the sun got lower and lower, and night was fast approaching.
Then the conviction, which had long been gaining ground in my
mind, took possession of the whole party. We had passed the forks
of the road before daylight, that morning, and were now miles out
on the desert without a mouthful of food for the cattle and only two
or three quarts of water in a little cask.</p>
<p>What could be done? Halt we must, for the oxen were nearly
worn out and night was coming on. The animals must at least rest,
if they could not be fed: and, that they might rest, they were chained
securely to the wagon, for, hungry and thirsty as they were, they
would, if loose, start off frantically in search of water and food, and
soon drop down exhausted. Having fastened them in such a way that
they could lie down, we took a few mouthfuls of food, and then, we
in our wagon and the men not far off upon the sand, fell wearily to
sleep; a forlorn little company wrecked upon the desert.</p>
<p>The first question in the morning was, &ldquo;How can the oxen be
kept from starving?&rdquo; A happy thought occurred. We had, thus far on
our journey, managed to keep something in the shape of a bed to
sleep on. It was a mattress-tick, and, just before leaving Salt Lake,
we had put into it some fresh hay&mdash;not very much, for our load
must be as light as possible; but the old gentleman traveling with us
also had a small straw mattress; the two together might keep the
poor things from starving for a few hours. At once a small portion
was dealt out to them and for the present they were saved. For ourselves
we had food which we believed would about last us till we
reached the Gold Mines if we could go right on: if we were much
delayed anywhere, it was doubtful. The two or three quarts of water
in our little cask would last only a few hours, to give moderate drinks
to each of the party.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They decided they must return, the distance to the next waterhole was
too far. Soon after they began retracing their steps, they met another
group of emigrants, who confirmed their suspicions that they had missed
the turn 15 miles back.</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<p>I had now become so impressed with the danger of the cattle
giving out, that I refused to ride except for occasional brief rests. So,
soon after losing sight of the dust of the envied little caravan, I left
the wagon and walked the remainder of the day. For a good while
I kept near the wagon but, by and by, being very weary I fell behind.
The sun had set, before we reached the Sink, and the light was fading
fast when the wagon disappeared from my sight behind a slight elevation;
and, as the others had gone on in advance some time before,
I was all alone on the barren waste. However, as I recognized the
features of the neighborhood, and knew we were quite near the Sink,
I felt no particular apprehension, only a feeling that it was a weird
and dreary scene and instinctively urged forward my lagging footsteps
in hope of regaining sight of the wagon....</p>
<p>The next morning we resumed our backward march after feeding
out the last mouthful of fodder. The water in the little cask was
nearly used up in making coffee for supper and breakfast; but, if
only each one would be moderate in taking a share when thirst impelled
him, we might yet reach the wells before any one suffered
seriously. We had lately had but few chances for cooking; and only
a little boiled rice with dried fruit, and a few bits of biscuit remained
after we had done breakfast. If we could only reach the meadows by
noon. But that we could hardly hope for, the animals were so weak
and tired. There was no alternative, however, the only thing to be
done was to go steadily on, determined to do and endure....</p>
<p>I found no difficulty this morning in keeping up with the team.
They went so slowly, and I was so preternaturally [<i>unnaturally</i>]
stimulated by anxiety to get forward, that, before I was aware of it
I would be some rods ahead of the cattle, straining my gaze as if
expecting to see a land of promise, long before I had any rational
hope of the kind. My imagination acted intensely. I seemed to see
Hagar, in the wilderness walking wearily away from her fainting
child among the dried-up bushes, and seating herself in the hot sand.
I seemed to become Hagar myself, and when my little one, from the
wagon behind me, called out, &ldquo;Mamma I want a drink&rdquo;&mdash;I stopped,
gave her some, noted that there were but a few swallows left, then
mechanically pressed onward again, alone, repeating, over and over,
the words, &ldquo;Let me not see the death of the child.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<p>Just in the heat of noonday we came to where the sage bushes
were nearer together; and a fire, left by campers or Indians, had
spread for some distance, leaving beds of ashes, and occasionally
charred skeletons of bushes to make the scene more dreary. . . .</p>
<p>Wearily passed the hottest noonday hour, with many an anxious
look at the horned-heads, which seemed to me to bow lower and
lower, while the poor tired hoofs almost refused to move. The two
young men had been out of sight for some time; when, all at once,
we heard a shout, and saw, a few hundred yards in advance a couple
of hats thrown into the air and four hands waving triumphantly.
As soon as we got near enough, we heard them call out, &ldquo;Grass and
water! Grass and water!&rdquo; and shortly we were at the meadows.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="c6">A Tour on the Prairies</h2>
<p>When wagon trains reached Independence, Missouri, and prepared to
jump off for the Far West, they faced some six hundred miles of prairie
before reaching the mountains. There was water, grass, and game (especially
buffalo) in abundance, but it was an awesome spectacle to travel
week after week across the empty plains. When Washington Irving returned
from many years in Europe, he wanted to see the prairie and joined
an expedition in 1832 which traveled as far west as the present site of
Oklahoma City. One of his companions was Henry Ellsworth, a commissioner
appointed by Andrew Jackson to help pacify the Indians. In the
selection that follows, Ellsworth describes the prairie in central Oklahoma,
tells how one of his men captured a wild horse, and recounts his own experience
in shooting a buffalo.</p>
<h3 id="c7">Henry Ellsworth Accompanies Washington Irving Across the Plains</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The country today is truly delightful. The prairies are smooth,
the streams frequent, and meandering so as to present a vigorous
growth of stately trees on every side. The flowers of spring have disappeared
and left the numerous stalks covered with seeds as mementoes
of vernal fragrance, but the autumnal blossoms mixed with the
prairie grass never fail to attract the eye with delight, or refresh the
lungs by their sweet odours. My late travelling companion, Dr.
O&rsquo;Dwyer, says Eden was here and not on the Euphrates: &ldquo;Adam&rsquo;s
paradise was in these prairies!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<p>Mr. Irving said often today that the most splendid parks in
England did not surpass the beautiful scenery around us, and yet
between both there was such a striking resemblance as to recall to
his mind at once the delightful rambles he had in Europe where art
had been lavish in her favors to enhance the beauties of nature.
I can say also, though my residence in Europe was short, that I beheld
no scenery there so truly beautiful and grand as the rich prairies
of the West. And if the prairies now are so charming, what must they
be decked with the variegated plumage of spring?...</p>
<p>I ought perhaps to mention the woods on these parks afforded
excellent varieties of fruits. The season now was too late for most of
them&mdash;the persimmon, haws, and winter grape were very abundant.</p>
<p>Our ride was made more cheering by the fresh signs of buffalo.
Not the short grass but tracks and recent dung (resembling entirely
that of our oxen and cows) assured us we should soon meet these
<i>terrific</i> animals. Excavations in the ground showed where they indulged
in their great pastime, in <i>wallowing</i>. The excavations are
generally about 10 feet in diameter and 12 to 20 inches deep. It is
these hollows, especially when filled with water, that make the chase,
as I found it afterwards, so difficult and dangerous. The trees also
furnish <i>their</i> evidence and every low limb was worn by the buffalo
while scratching his skin after coming out of his mud or sand bath.</p>
<hr />
<p>As soon as we had arrived at camp this evening, Billet requested
the privilege to hunt a while, and mounting his horse with lariat and
gun, cantered off, and was soon out of sight. The firing on all sides
assured us we should have plenty of game, and the hunters soon returned
loaded with deer, turkeys, etc. It was not until after supper
that Billet came to our camp quite out of breath and asked for help
to bring in a wild horse he had just caught the other side of Red
Fork. He had brought him through the river, but got him no
farther....</p>
<p>The horse was soon brought in, trembling at the sight of so many
new things. He was between two and three years old, well made, and
will doubtless make an excellent horse. The horse struggled for a
while against Billet&rsquo;s mode of civilization and fell exhausted in the
struggle. He panted and lay as submissive as a lamb. Twenty or
thirty handled him from head to foot without any offer on his part
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
to make resistance. He gave up the contest and submitted unconditionally
and never afterwards was more disobedient than colts in
general, nor indeed as much.... Tomorrow Billet said he should
pack him with a saddle and make him do his share of work. We did
not believe it possible and waited with curiosity to see the experiment.
[<i>He succeeded. Eds.</i>]</p>
<p>Billet is an adventuresome as well as brave man. He has had both
arms and one leg broken during exploits besides having his ribs on
one side mashed in. He told us when he saw the horses they were
distant from him. He stopped, laid down his gun, adjusted his saddle,
and with lariat in hand he put spurs to his race horse, whose speed
I never saw excelled. The wild horses stood amazed for a moment,
then started and fled. They ran up a small hill and descending again
were for a moment out of sight. When Billet came to the brow, he
was frightened: a precipice was before him which he must leap or
lose his prize. He chose the former, shut his eyes, and strained upon
the reins and safely landed upon the bottom&mdash;a leap of 25 feet. His
horse, accustomed to the race, soon recovered from the shock and
continued pursuit. The race now continued for 1&frac12; miles. He then
reached the horses, and having failed in his first effort to take a
Pawnee mare (with a slit in her ears) he put his lariat over the head
of the horse brought to the camp. It was truly a great exploit....</p>
<hr />
<p>No sooner had I reined my horse towards the buffalo (notwithstanding
he had been racing several hours and was then wet with
perspiration) than he pricked up his ears and entered into a full run.
I <i>never</i> went <i>half so fast before or mean to again</i>. I ran a quarter of
a mile before [<i>the</i>] buffalo apprehended danger. They then began
to make the best of their way to the west. Billet called out: &ldquo;Remember
the holes; let <i>him run</i>; let <i>him run</i>.&rdquo; After running 1&frac12; miles with
gun in hand, almost tired to death and shook not a little, I came
along side of the animal I had selected. He appeared a monster, for
his weight was 1600. I fired. Billet said: &ldquo;Take care; he will be
upon you.&rdquo; The animal now began to throw blood from his mouth
and nose, which satisfied me I had reached his heart. He stopped. I
fired again. Both balls entered just <i>back of his fore shoulder</i>. He
now came towards me with his tongue extended and his round full
eye darting vengeance. My horse parried his movements, and I fired
my rifle pistol and then seized the remaining one. At this moment
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
the buffalo fell, exhausted with the loss of blood, and stretching out
his legs died before I could get to him.... Billet performed the operation
of cutting out his tongue, by opening the flesh on the under
jaw and through this aperture taking the tongue, which I tied to my
saddle and reached the camp a little after sunset.</p>

<h2 id="c8">The Indians</h2>
<p>Ever since James Fenimore Cooper made use of frontier life in his
novels, the Indian has been romanticized in fiction as the noble savage. But
Cooper&rsquo;s Indians did not bear much resemblance to the real Indians who
were, after all, savages living in a primitive environment. A good observer
of Indians as they actually were was the eminent historian Francis Parkman,
who spent the summer of 1846 traveling as far as Wyoming on the
Oregon Trail. Here is his account of one of the tribes living on the plains:</p>
<h3 id="c9">Henry Ellsworth Accompanies Washington Irving Across the Plains</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>When we came in sight of our little white tent under the big
tree, we saw that it no longer stood alone. A huge old lodge was
erected by its side, discolored by rain and storms, rotten with age,
with the uncouth figures of horses and men and outstretched hands
that were painted upon it, well nigh obliterated. The long poles
which supported this squalid habitation thrust themselves rakishly
out from its pointed top, and over its entrance were suspended a
&ldquo;medicine-pipe&rdquo; and various other implements of the magic art.
While we were yet at a distance, we observed a greatly increased
population of various colors and dimensions, swarming about our
quiet encampment.</p>
<p>Morin, the trapper, having been absent for a day or two, had
returned, it seemed, bringing all his family with him. He had taken
to himself a wife, for whom he had paid the established price of one
horse. This looks cheap at first sight, but in truth the purchase of a
squaw is a transaction which no man should enter into without mature
deliberation, since it involves not only the payment of the price,
but the burden of feeding and supporting a rapacious horde of the
bride&rsquo;s relatives, who hold themselves entitled to feed upon the indiscreet
white man. They gather about him like leeches, and drain
him of all he has....</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>The moving spirit of the establishment was an old hag of eighty.
Human imagination never conceived hob-goblin or witch more ugly
than she. You could count all her ribs through the wrinkles of her
leathery skin. Her withered face more resembled an old skull than
the countenance of a living being, even to the hollow, darkened
sockets, at the bottom of which glittered her little black eyes. Her
arms had dwindled into nothing but whip-cord and wire. Her hair,
half black, half gray, hung in total neglect nearly to the ground, and
her sole garment consisted of the remnant of a discarded buffalo-robe
tied around her waist with a string of hide.</p>
<p>Yet the old squaw&rsquo;s meagre anatomy was wonderfully strong.
She pitched the lodge, packed the horses, and did the hardest labor
of the camp. From morning till night she bustled about the lodge,
screaming like a screech-owl when anything displeased her. Her
brother, a &ldquo;medicine-man,&rdquo; or magician, was equally gaunt and
sinewy with herself. His mouth spread from ear to ear, and his appetite,
as we had occasion to learn, was ravenous in proportion....</p>
<p>A day passed, and Indians began rapidly to come in. Parties of
two, three, or more would ride up and silently seat themselves on the
grass. The fourth day came at last, when about noon horsemen appeared
in view on the summit of the neighboring ridge. Behind followed
a wild procession, hurrying in haste and disorder down the
hill and over the plain below; horses, mules, and dogs; heavily burdened
<i>traineaux</i> [<i>sleds</i>], mounted warriors, squaws walking amid
the throng, and a host of children. For a full half-hour they continued
to pour down; and keeping directly to the bend of the stream,
within a furlong of us, they soon assembled there, a dark and confused
throng, until, as if by magic, a hundred and fifty tall lodges
sprang up. The lonely plain was transformed into the site of a swarming
encampment. Countless horses were soon grazing over the
meadows around us, and the prairie was animated by restless figures
careering on horseback, or sedately stalking in their long white
robes....</p>
<p>The Dahcotah or Sioux range over a vast territory, from the river
St. Peter to the Rocky Mountains. They are divided into several independent
bands, united under no central government, and acknowledging
no common head. The same language, usages, and superstitions
form the sole bond between them. They do not unite even
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
in their wars. The bands of the east fight the Ojibwas on the Upper
Lakes; those of the west make incessant war upon the Snake Indians
in the Rocky Mountains. As the whole people is divided into bands,
so each band is divided into villages.</p>
<p>Each village has a chief, who is honored and obeyed only so far
as his personal qualities may command respect and fear. Sometimes
he is a mere nominal chief; sometimes his authority is little short of
absolute, and his fame and influence reach beyond his own village,
so that the whole band to which he belongs is ready to acknowledge
him as their head. This was, a few years since, the case with the
Ogillallah. Courage, address, and enterprise may raise any warrior
to the highest honor, especially if he be the son of a former chief,
or a member of a numerous family, to support him and avenge his
quarrels; but when he has reached the dignity of chief, and the old
men and warriors, by a peculiar ceremony, have formally installed
him, let it not be imagined that he assumes any of the outward signs
of rank and honor. He knows too well on how frail a tenure he holds
his station. He must conciliate his uncertain subjects.</p>
<p>Many a man in the village lives better, owns more squaws and
more horses, and goes better clad than he. Like the Teutonic chiefs
of old, he ingratiates himself with his young men by making them
presents, thereby often impoverishing himself. If he fails to gain
their favor, they will set his authority at naught, and may desert him
at any moment; for the usages of his people have provided no means
of enforcing his authority. Very seldom does it happen, at least
among these western bands, that a chief attains to much power, unless
he is the head of a numerous family. Frequently the village is
principally made up of his relatives and descendants, and the wandering
community assumes much of the patriarchal character.</p>

<h2 id="c10">The Trappers</h2>
<p>The fur trade was an important industry long before the Revolution, but
after the Westward Movement opened up the region beyond the Mississippi,
the search for furs moved to the Rocky Mountains and the Pacific
Northwest. Much of the Far West was first visited by the trappers, who
ranged widely in their lonely and often hazardous vocation. Many of them
were French Canadians or of French extraction, such as Henry Chatillon,
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
the guide of Parkman&rsquo;s party. In the following selection we have printed
an episode from the early career of General Isaac Jones Wistar, who later
became a general in the Union Army during the Civil War. Wistar at this
time, about 1850, was running his trap lines in the Peace River region of
western Canada. Fran&ccedil;ois is his partner. Needless to say, trapping was a
winter occupation.</p>
<h3 id="c11">Isaac Jones Wistar Endures a Hard Winter</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>After the trapper has laid in his provisions, disposed of his
horses, and settled down in his solitary winter quarters, incidents are
few; and as none of a pleasant character are likely to occur, the
fewer they are, the better for him....</p>
<p>In our case about this time, martens being scarce and the camp,
in consequence of the lateness of our arrival, having been badly
chosen, it was found necessary to shift it in the dead of winter; for
which purpose, taking but little provision from our scanty store and
<i>caching</i> the rest of our effects, we pushed out in a northerly direction,
hoping to find a better location on some of the other tributaries of
the Peace. But with ground covered by heavy snow, streams hard
bound with ice, and frequent wind storms which at the low prevailing
temperatures none can face and live, our progress was slow and
no place looked very attractive. Hence no great time had elapsed
before we found our provisions exhausted, in a difficult country with
game not to be had. Making a temporary shelter in a bad place and
under unfavorable circumstances, we therefore proceeded to devote
our whole attention to hunting, till after some days we became awake
to the fact that the district was absolutely without game. Every day
the weather permitted, we covered long distances in opposite directions,
without finding so much as a recent sign or track. Then we
set traps for fish in such rapids as remained open, and for birds and
small animals, but without success....</p>
<p>After trying in vain all the resources practiced by trappers in
such straits, all of which were well known to Fran&ccedil;ois, we ate the
grease in our rifle stocks, all the fringes and unnecessary parts of
our buck-leather clothes, gun and ammunition bags, and every scrap
of eatable material, boiling it down in an Assinaboine basket with
hot stones, and were finally reduced to buds and twigs. After many
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
days of this extreme privation, no longer possessing strength to
travel or hunt, I became discouraged; and as we lay down one night
I determined to abandon the struggle and remain there, enduring
with such fortitude as I might the final pangs, which could not be
long deferred. At this last stage in the struggle, an event occurred
of the most extraordinary character, which cannot seem more
strange and incredible to any one than it has always appeared to me
on the innumerable occasions when I have since reflected on it. Notwithstanding
our exhaustion and desperate conclusion of the night
before, Fran&ccedil;ois rose at daylight, made up the fire as well as his
strength permitted, blazed a tree near by on which he marked with
charcoal a large cross, and carefully reloading and standing his gun
against that emblem, proceeded to repeat in such feeble whispers
as he was yet capable of, all the scraps of French and Latin prayers
he could remember, to all of which I was in no condition to give
much attention. When he got through he remarked with much cheerfulness
that he was now sure of killing something and urged me to
make one more effort with him, which I rather angrily refused, and
bade him lie down and take what had to come, like a man. With
cheerful assurance he replied that he was not afraid to die, but our
time had not come. He knew he would find and kill, and we would
escape all right. Then desisting from his useless effort to get me up,
Fran&ccedil;ois, leaving his heavy snow-shoes behind, directed himself with
weak and uneven steps down the little stream in the deep gorge of
which our camp was made; and never expecting to see him again,
my mind relapsed into an idle, vacuous condition, in which external
circumstances were forgotten or disregarded. But scarcely a few
minutes had elapsed, and as it afterwards appeared he had hardly traversed
a couple of hundred yards when I heard his gun, which I knew
never cracked in vain.</p>
<p>I had thought myself unable to rise, but at that joyful sound
promptly discovered my mistake. I found Fran&ccedil;ois in the spot from
which he had fired, leaning against a tree in such deep excitement
that he could speak with difficulty. On that rugged side hill apparently
destitute of life, in that most improbable of all places, within
sound and smell of our camp, he had seen, not a squirrel or a rabbit,
but a deer. Attempting to climb for a better shot, the deer jumped,
and with terrible misgivings he had fired at it running. He had heard
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
it running after his shot but was sure he had made a killing hit.
Scrambling with difficulty up the hill, we found a large clot of blood
and a morsel of &ldquo;lights&rdquo; [<i>lungs</i>], which we divided and ate on the
spot. After taking up the trail we soon found the animal....</p>
<p>After passing safely through that period of starvation, we were
glad enough to get back to the old camp and make the best of it
during the remainder of the season, which furnished little more of incident
to vary the monotony of our solitary occupation.</p>

<h2 id="c12">The Emigrants</h2>
<p>In the year that Parkman visited Wyoming, 1846, the Oregon Trail was
a well-traveled route. Thousands of emigrants in covered wagons were
moving westward from Independence or St. Joseph, Missouri, along the
Platte River towards Wyoming and the South Pass over the Rockies. In the
next selection Parkman describes an emigrant train he encountered near
the point where the trail struck the Platte River in central Nebraska.</p>
<h3 id="c13">Francis Parkman Encounters a Wagon Train</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>About dark a sallow-faced fellow descended the hill on horseback,
and splashing through the pool, rode up to the tents. He was
enveloped in a huge cloak, and his broad felt hat was weeping about
his ears with the drizzling moisture of the evening. Another followed,
a stout, square-built, intelligent-looking man, who announced himself
as leader of an emigrant party, encamped a mile in advance of
us. About twenty wagons, he said, were with him; the rest of his
party were on the other side of the Big Blue, waiting for a woman
who was in the pains of childbirth, and quarreling meanwhile among
themselves.</p>
<p>These were the first emigrants that we had overtaken, although
we had found abundant and melancholy traces of their progress
throughout the course of the journey. Sometimes we passed the grave
of one who had sickened and died on the way. The earth was usually
torn up, and covered thickly with wolf-tracks. Some had escaped
this violation. One morning, a piece of plank, standing upright on
the summit of a grassy hill, attracted our notice, and riding up to it,
we found the following words very roughly traced upon it, apparently
with a red-hot piece of iron:&mdash;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p class="center">MARY ELLIS
<br />DIED MAY 7th, 1845
<br />Aged two months.</p>
<p>Such tokens were of common occurrence.</p>
<p>We were late in breaking up our camp on the following morning,
and scarcely had we ridden a mile when we saw ... the emigrant
caravan, with its heavy white wagons creeping on in slow procession,
and a large drove of cattle following behind. Half a dozen yellow-visaged
Missourians, mounted on horseback, were cursing and
shouting among them, their lank angular proportions enveloped in
brown homespun, evidently cut and adjusted by the hands of a
domestic female tailor. As we approached, they called out to us:
&ldquo;How are ye, boys? Are ye for Oregon or California?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As we pushed rapidly by the wagons, children&rsquo;s faces were thrust
out from the white coverings to look at us; while the care-worn, thin-featured
matron, or the buxom girl, seated in front, suspended the
knitting on which most of them were engaged to stare at us with
wondering curiosity. By the side of each wagon stalked the proprietor,
urging on his patient oxen, who shouldered heavily along,
inch by inch, on their interminable journey. It was easy to see that
fear and dissension prevailed among them.... Many were murmuring
against the leader they had chosen, and wished to depose him....</p>
<p>We soon left them far behind, and hoped that we had taken a
final leave; but our companions&rsquo; wagon stuck so long in a deep
muddy ditch, that before it was extricated the van of the emigrant
caravan appeared again, descending a ridge close at hand. Wagon
after wagon plunged through the mud; and as it was nearly noon,
and the place promised shade and water, we saw with satisfaction
that they were resolved to encamp. Soon the wagons were wheeled
into a circle: the cattle were grazing over the meadow, and the men,
with sour, sullen faces, were looking about for wood and water. They
seemed to meet but indifferent success. As we left the ground, I saw
a tall slouching fellow ... contemplating the contents of his tin cup,
which he had just filled with water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, you,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s chock-full of animals!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cup, as he held it out, exhibited in fact an extraordinary
variety and profusion of animal and vegetable life.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>Riding up the little hill, and looking back on the meadow, we
could easily see that all was not right in the camp of the emigrants.
The men were crowded together, and an angry discussion seemed to
be going forward. R&mdash;&mdash; [<i>one of Parkman&rsquo;s party</i>] was missing
from his wonted place in the line, and the Captain told us that
he had remained behind to get his horse shod by a blacksmith
attached to the emigrant party. Something whispered in our ears
that mischief was on foot; we kept on, however, and coming soon to
a stream of tolerable water, we stopped to rest and dine. Still the
absentee lingered behind. At last, at the distance of a mile, he and
his horse suddenly appeared, sharply defined against the sky on the
summit of a hill; and close behind, a huge white object rose slowly
into view.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is that blockhead bringing with him now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A moment dispelled the mystery. Slowly and solemnly, one behind
the other, four long trains of oxen and four emigrant wagons
rolled over the crest of the hill and gravely descended, while R&mdash;&mdash;
rode in state in the van. It seems that during the process of shoeing
the horse the smothered dissensions among the emigrants suddenly
broke into open rupture. Some insisted on pushing forward, some
on remaining where they were, and some on going back. Kearsley,
their captain, threw up his command in disgust. &ldquo;And now, boys,&rdquo;
said he, &ldquo;if any of you are for going ahead, just you come along
with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Four wagons, with ten men, one woman, and one small child,
made up the force of the &ldquo;go-ahead&rdquo; faction, and R&mdash;&mdash;, with his
usual proclivity toward mischief, invited them to join our party.
Fear of the Indians&mdash;for I can conceive no other motive&mdash;must have
induced him to court so burdensome an alliance. At all events, the
proceeding was a cool one. The men who joined us, it is true, were
all that could be desired; rude indeed in manners, but frank, manly,
and intelligent. To tell them we could not travel with them was out of
the question. I merely reminded Kearsley that if his oxen could not
keep up with our mules he must expect to be left behind, as we could
not consent to be farther delayed on the journey; but he immediately
replied, that his oxen &ldquo;<i>should</i> keep up; and if they couldn&rsquo;t, why, he
allowed, he&rsquo;d find out how to make &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c14">To California by Sea</h2>
<p>We now have introduced the land and the people: the mountains,
deserts, and prairies; the Indians, trappers, and settlers. This is the cast of
characters, so to speak, who played out the drama of winning the West.
The next group of selections will illustrate the ways by which the land was
tamed and the wilderness brought under the yoke of civilization. We will
visit California by ship, travel with the covered wagons, starve with the
Donner party in the Sierras, and ride the Overland Stage with Mark Twain.
Finally we will look at the building of the railroad, the event that spelled
the end of the Old West.</p>
<p>The coast of California was first explored by Juan Cabrillo in 1542,
but it was not until the time of the American Revolution that the Spanish
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
established effective political control as far north as San Francisco. Then,
for the next three quarters of a century, until the Mexican War, Spanish
culture flourished. By the time California was annexed to the United States,
a great deal of commerce was being carried on between eastern United
States ports and the West Coast, and when the gold rush took place
thousands of fortune seekers came to California via sea.</p>
<h3 id="c15">Richard Henry Dana, Jr., Visits the Coast of California</h3>
<p>One of the best descriptions of California before it became part of the
United States was written by a young Bostonian, Richard Henry Dana, Jr.
This young man suffered eye trouble during his sophomore year at Harvard
and sailed for California in 1834 as a common sailor. After working 15
months on the California coast gathering hides, the cargo that American
ships carried home in exchange for manufactured products, he returned
to Harvard and completed his education. His book, <i>Two Years Before the
Mast</i>, from which the next selection is taken, is a splendid adventure story.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Just before sun-down the mate ordered a boat&rsquo;s crew ashore,
and I went as one of the number. We passed under the stern of the
English brig, and had a long pull ashore. I shall never forget the impression
which our first landing on the beach of California made
upon me. The sun had just gone down; it was getting dusky; the
damp night wind was beginning to blow, and the heavy swell of the
Pacific was setting in, and breaking in loud and high &ldquo;combers&rdquo;
upon the beach. We lay on our oars in the swell, just outside of the
surf, waiting for a good chance to run in, when a boat, which had put
off from the <i>Ayacucho</i> just after us, came alongside of us, with a
crew of dusky Sandwich Islanders, talking and hallooing in their
outlandish tongue. [<i>This landing took place at Santa Barbara.</i>]</p>
<p>They knew that we were novices in this kind of boating, and
waited to see us go in. The second mate, however, who steered our
boat, determined to have the advantage of their experience, and
would not go in first. Finding, at length, how matters stood, they
gave a shout, and taking advantage of a great comber which came
swelling in, rearing its head, and lifting up the stern of our boat
nearly perpendicular, and again dropping it in the trough, they gave
three or four long and strong pulls, and went in on top of the great
wave, throwing their oars overboard, and as far from the boat as
they could throw them, and jumping out the instant that the boat
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
touched the beach, and then seizing hold of her and running her up
high and dry upon the sand.</p>
<p>We saw, at once, how it was to be done, and also the necessity
of keeping the boat &ldquo;stern on&rdquo; to the sea; for the instant the sea
should strike upon her broad-side or quarter, she would be driven up
broad-side on, and capsized. We pulled strongly in, and as soon as
we felt that the sea had got hold of us and was carrying us in with
the speed of a race-horse, we threw the oars as far from the boat as
we could, and took hold of the gunwale, ready to spring out and
seize her when she struck, the officer using his utmost strength to
keep her stern on. We were shot up upon the beach like an arrow
from a bow, and seizing the boat, ran her up high and dry, and soon
picked up our oars, and stood by her, ready for the captain to come
down.</p>
<p>Finding that the captain did not come immediately, we put our
oars in the boat, and leaving one to watch it, walked about the beach
to see what we could of the place. The beach is nearly a mile in
length between the two points, and of smooth sand. We had taken
the only good landing-place, which is in the middle; it being more
stony toward the ends. It is about twenty yards in width from high-water
mark to a slight bank at which the soil begins, and so hard
that it is a favorite place for running horses. It was growing dark, so
that we could just distinguish the dim outlines of the two vessels in
the offing; and the great seas were rolling in, in regular lines, growing
larger and larger as they approached the shore, and hanging over
the beach upon which they were to break, when their tops would curl
over and turn white with foam, and, beginning at one extreme of
the line, break rapidly to the other, as a long card-house falls when
the children knock down the cards at one end.</p>
<p>The Sandwich Islanders, in the meantime, had turned their boat
round, and ran her down into the water, and were loading her with
hides and tallow. As this was the work in which we were soon to be
engaged, we looked on with some curiosity. They ran the boat into
the water so far that every large sea might float her, and two of them,
with their trousers rolled up, stood by the bows, one on each side,
keeping her in her right position. This was hard work; for beside
the force they had to use upon the boat, the large seas nearly took
them off their legs. The others were running from the boat to the
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
bank, upon which, out of the reach of the water, was a pile of dry
bullocks&rsquo; hides, doubled lengthwise in the middle, and nearly as
stiff as boards. These they took upon their heads, one or two at a
time, and carried down to the boat, where one of their number
stowed them away. They were obliged to carry them on their heads,
to keep them out of the water, and we observed that they had on
thick woolen caps. &ldquo;Look here, Bill, and see what you&rsquo;re coming to!&rdquo;
said one of our men to another who stood by the boat. &ldquo;Well,
D&mdash;&mdash;,&rdquo; said the second mate to me, &ldquo;this does not look much like
Cambridge college, does it? This is what I call &lsquo;<i>head work</i>&rsquo;.&rdquo; To tell
the truth, it did not look very encouraging.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="c16">A Day with the Cow Column</h2>
<p>The following account of life on the Oregon Trail was written by Jesse
Applegate, who traveled West in 1843 with an emigrant train of 60 wagons
and thousands of cattle. Perhaps 500 persons journeyed with this caravan,
which was well organized and well led, a bigger and better equipped
expedition than the one Parkman met three years later. Here is a typical
day on the trail:</p>
<h3 id="c17">Jesse Applegate Herds Cattle on the Oregon Trail</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>It is four o&rsquo;clock <span class="small">A.M.</span>; the sentinels on duty have discharged
their rifles&mdash;the signal that the hours of sleep are over; and every
wagon and tent is pouring forth its night tenants, and slow-kindling
smokes begin largely to rise and float away upon the morning air.
Sixty men start from the corral, spreading as they make through the
vast herd of cattle and horses that form a semi-circle around the encampment,
the most distant perhaps two miles away.</p>
<p>The herders pass to the extreme verge and carefully examine
for trails beyond, to see that none of the animals have strayed or
been stolen during the night. This morning no trails lead beyond the
outside animals in sight, and by five o&rsquo;clock the herders begin to
contract the great moving circle and the well-trained animals move
slowly toward camp, clipping here and there a thistle or a tempting
bunch of grass on the way. In about an hour five thousand animals
are close up to the encampment, and the teamsters are busy selecting
their teams and driving them inside the &ldquo;corral&rdquo; to be yoked. The
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
corral is a circle one hundred yards deep, formed with wagons connected
strongly with each other, the wagon in the rear being connected
with the wagon in front by its tongue and ox chains. It is a
strong barrier that the most vicious ox cannot break, and in case of
an attack of the Sioux would be no contemptible entrenchment.</p>
<p>From six to seven o&rsquo;clock is a busy time; breakfast is to be eaten,
the tents struck, the wagons loaded, and the teams yoked and
brought up in readiness to be attached to their respective wagons.
All know when, at seven o&rsquo;clock, the signal to march sounds, that
those not ready to take their proper places in the line of march must
fall into the dusty rear for the day.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At seven the bugle sounds and the party moves out, led by the pilot
and his guards. Meantime, a group of young men form a hunting party to
look for buffalo. It is from the viewpoint of the hunters on the bluffs of the
river that we next see the emigrant train:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are full six miles away from the line of march; though everything
is dwarfed by distance, it is seen distinctly. The caravan has
been about two hours in motion and is now as widely extended as a
prudent regard for safety will permit. First, near the bank of the
shining river, is a company of horsemen; they seem to have found
an obstruction, for the main body has halted while three or four ride
rapidly along the bank of the creek or slough. They are hunting a
favorable crossing for the wagons; while we look they have succeeded;
it has apparently required no work to make it passable, for
all but one of the party have passed on and he has raised a flag, no
doubt a signal to the wagons to steer their course to where he stands.
The leading teamster sees him though he is yet two miles off, and
steers his course directly towards him, all the wagons following in
his track. They (the wagons) form a line three quarters of a mile
in length; some of the teamsters ride upon the front of their wagons,
some march beside their teams; scattered along the line companies of
women and children are taking exercise on foot; they gather bouquets
of rare and beautiful flowers that line the way; near them stalks
a stately greyhound or an Irish wolf dog, apparently proud of keeping
watch and ward over his master&rsquo;s wife and children.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>Next comes a band of horses; two or three men or boys follow
them, the docile and sagacious animals scarce needing this attention,
for they have learned to follow in the rear of the wagons, and know
that at noon they will be allowed to graze and rest. Their knowledge
of time seems as accurate as of the place they are to occupy in the
line, and even a full-blown thistle will scarcely tempt them to straggle
or halt until the dinner hour has arrived. Not so with the large herd
of horned beasts that bring up the rear; lazy, selfish and unsocial, it
has been a task to get them in motion; the strong, always ready to
domineer over the weak, halt in front and forbid the weaker to pass
them. They seem to move only in fear of the driver&rsquo;s whip; though
in the morning full to repletion, they have not been driven an hour
before their hunger and thirst seem to indicate a fast of days&rsquo; duration.
Through all the long day their greed is never satisfied, nor their
thirst quenched, nor is there a moment of relaxation of the tedious
and vexatious labors of their drivers, although to all others the
march furnishes some season of relaxation or enjoyment. For the
cow-drivers there is none....</p>
<p>The pilot, by measuring the ground and timing the speed of the
wagons and the walk of his horses, has determined the rate of each,
so as to enable him to select the nooning place, as near as the
requisite grass and water can be had at the end of five hours&rsquo; travel
of the wagons. Today, the ground being favorable, little time has
been lost in preparing the road, so that he and his pioneers are at
the nooning place an hour in advance of the wagons, which time is
spent in preparing convenient watering places for the animals and
digging little wells near the bank of the Platte. As the teams are not
unyoked, but simply turned loose from the wagons, a corral is not
formed at noon, but the wagons are drawn up in columns, four
abreast, the leading wagon of each platoon on the left&mdash;the platoons
being formed with that view. This brings friends together at noon as
well as at night....</p>
<p>It is now one o&rsquo;clock; the bugle has sounded, and the caravan
has resumed its westward journey. It is in the same order, but the
evening is far less animated than the morning march; a drowsiness
has fallen apparently on man and beast; teamsters drop asleep on
their perches and even when walking by their teams, and the words
of command are now addressed to the slowly creeping oxen in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
softened tenor of women or the piping treble of children, while the
snares of teamsters make a droning accompaniment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As the sun goes down, the pilot halts the column for the night. The
evening meal is prepared, watches are set, and another day of the march
comes to an end.</p>
<h2 id="c18">The Donner Party Starves</h2>
<p>The hardships of the trail took their toll from the west-bound settlers.
The Donner party, which left Illinois in the summer of 1846, reached the
Sierras in October after the winter snows had begun. Marooned at what
is now Donner Lake, this group slowly starved to death until only 48 out of
the original 87 were left when rescue parties broke through to them in
February. Some of them even turned to cannibalism to survive. The following
narrative, which does not mention cannibalism, nonetheless tells vividly
of the ordeal of that terrible winter. The author is Virginia Reed Murphy,
who was a child at the time of the ordeal.</p>
<h3 id="c19">Virginia Reed Murphy Survives a Terrible Ordeal</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Snow was already falling, although it was only the last week in
October. Winter had set in a month earlier than usual. All trails and
roads were covered, and our only guide was the summit, which it
seemed we would never reach. Despair drove many nearly frantic.
Each family tried to cross the mountains but found it impossible.
When it was seen that the wagons could not be dragged through the
snow, their goods and provisions were packed on oxen and another
start was made, men and women walking in snow up to their waists,
carrying their children in their arms and trying to drive their cattle.
The Indians said they could find no road; so a halt was called, and
Stanton went ahead with the guides and came back and reported
that we could get across if we kept right on, but that it would be impossible
if [<i>more</i>] snow fell. He was in favor of a forced march until
the other side of the summit should be reached, but some of our party
were so tired and exhausted with the day&rsquo;s labor that they declared
they could not take another step; so the few who knew the danger
that the night might bring yielded to the many, and we camped within
three miles of the summit.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>That night came the dreaded snow. Around the campfires under
the trees great feathery flakes came whirling down. The air was so
full of them that one could see objects only a few feet away.... With
heavy hearts we turned back to a cabin that had been built ... on
the shore of a lake, since known as Donner Lake. The Donners were
camped in Alder Creek Valley below the lake.... The snow came
on so suddenly that they had no time to build cabins, but hastily put
up brush sheds, covering them with pine boughs....</p>
<p>Many attempts were made to cross the mountains, but all who
tried were driven back by the pitiless storms. Finally a party was
organized, since known as the &ldquo;Forlorn Hope.&rdquo; They made snowshoes,
and fifteen started&mdash;ten men and five women&mdash;but only seven
lived to reach California; eight men perished. They were over a
month on the way, and the horrors endured by that Forlorn Hope
no pen can describe nor imagination conceive....</p>
<p>The misery endured during those four months at Donner Lake in
our little dark cabins under the snow would fill pages and make the
coldest heart ache. Christmas was near, but to the starving its
memory gave no comfort. It came and passed without observance,
but my mother had determined weeks before that her children should
have a treat on this one day. She had laid away a few dried apples,
some beans, a bit of tripe, and a small piece of bacon. When this
hoarded store was brought out, the delight of the little ones knew no
bounds. The cooking was watched carefully, and when we sat down
to our Christmas dinner, Mother said, &ldquo;Children, eat slowly, for this
one day you can have all you wish.&rdquo;...</p>
<p>The storms would often last ten days at a time, and we would
have to cut chips from the logs inside which formed our cabins in
order to start a fire. We could scarcely walk, and the men had hardly
strength to procure wood. We would drag ourselves through the snow
from one cabin to another, and some mornings snow would have to
be shoveled out of the fireplace before a fire could be made. Poor
little children were crying with hunger, and mothers were crying because
they had so little to give to their children. We seldom thought
of bread, we had been without it so long....</p>
<p>Time dragged slowly along till we were no longer on short allowance
but were simply starving. My mother determined to make an
effort to cross the mountains. She could not see her children die without
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
trying to get them food. It was hard to leave them, but she felt
that it must be done. She told them she would bring them bread, so
they were willing to stay, and with no guide but a compass we started&mdash;my
mother, Eliza, Milt Elliot, and myself. Milt wore snow-shoes,
and we followed in his tracks. We were five days in the mountains;
Eliza gave out the first day and had to return, but we kept on and
climbed one high mountain after another only to see others higher
still ahead. Often I would have to crawl up the mountains, being too
tired to walk ... we were compelled to return, and just in time, for
that night a storm came on, the most fearful of the winter, and we
should have perished had we not been in the cabins.</p>
<p>We now had nothing to eat but raw hides, and they were on the
roof of the cabin to keep out the snow; when prepared for cooking
and boiled they were simply a pot of glue. When the hides were
taken off our cabin and we were left without shelter, Mr. Breen gave
us a home with his family, and Mrs. Breen prolonged my life by
slipping me little bits of meat now and then when she discovered
that I could not eat the hide. Death had already claimed many in our
party, and it seemed as though relief never would reach us. Baylis
Williams, who had been in delicate health before we left Springfield,
was the first to die; he passed away before starvation had really set
in....</p>
<p>On his arrival at Sutter&rsquo;s Fort my father [<i>the author&rsquo;s father
had led a second and successful effort to cross the mountains to get
help</i>] made known the situation of the emigrants, and Captain
Sutter offered at once to do everything possible for their relief. He
furnished horses and provisions, and my father and Mr. McClutchen
started for the mountains, coming as far as possible with horses and
then with packs on their backs proceeding on foot; but they were
finally compelled to return. Captain Sutter was not surprised at their
defeat. He stated that there were no able-bodied men in that vicinity,
all having gone down the country with Fr&eacute;mont to fight the Mexicans.
He advised my father to go to Yerba Buena, now San Francisco,
and make his case known to the naval officer in command. My
father was in fact conducting parties there&mdash;when the seven members
of the Forlorn Hope arrived from across the mountains. Their
famished faces told the story. Cattle were killed and men were up all
night, drying beef and making flour by hand mills, nearly two hundred
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
pounds being made in one night, and a party of seven, commanded
by Captain Reasen P. Tucker, were sent to our relief by
Captain Sutter and the alcalde, Mr. Sinclair. On the evening of
February 19, 1847, they reached our cabins, where all were starving.
They shouted to attract attention. Mr. Breen clambered up the icy
steps from our cabin, and soon we heard the blessed words, &ldquo;Relief,
thank God, relief!&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c20">Mark Twain Rides the Overland Stage</h2>
<p>The career of Samuel Clemens (Mark Twain) as a river pilot ended when
the Civil War stopped steamboat traffic on the Mississippi. He then joined
his brother, who was going to Carson City, Nevada, to be secretary to the
governor of the territory. The brothers took a steamboat to St. Joseph,
Missouri, where they caught the Overland Stage. Sam Clemens&rsquo; account
of his trip to Nevada is a memorable picture of stagecoach travel across
the prairies and mountains just eight years before the railroads made the
Overland Stage obsolete. Here is a selection from <i>Roughing It</i>:</p>
<h3 id="c21">A Memorable Account of Stagecoach Travel from <i>Roughing It</i></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>It was now just dawn; and as we stretched our cramped legs full
length on the mail sacks, and gazed out through the windows across
the wide wastes of greensward clad in cool, powdery mist, to where
there was an expectant look in the eastern horizon, our perfect enjoyment
took the form of a tranquil and contented ecstasy. The stage
whirled along at a spanking gait, the breeze flapping curtains and
suspended coats in a most exhilarating way; the cradle swayed and
swung luxuriously, the pattering of the horses&rsquo; hoofs, the cracking of
the driver&rsquo;s whip, and his &ldquo;Hi-yi! g&rsquo;lang!&rdquo; were music; the spinning
ground and the waltzing trees appeared to give us a mute hurrah as
we went by, and then slack up and look after us with interest, or
envy, or something; and as we lay and smoked the pipe of peace and
compared all this luxury with the years of tiresome city life that had
gone before it, we felt that there was only one complete and satisfying
happiness in the world, and we had found it.</p>
<p>After breakfast, at some station whose name I have forgotten,
we three climbed up on the seat behind the driver, and let the conductor
have our bed for a nap. And by and by, when the sun made
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
me drowsy, I lay down on my face on top of the coach, grasping the
slender iron railing, and slept for an hour more. That will give one
an appreciable idea of those matchless roads. Instinct will make a
sleeping man grip a fast hold of the railing when the stage jolts, but
when it only swings and sways, no grip is necessary. Overland drivers
and conductors used to sit in their places and sleep thirty or forty
minutes at a time, on good roads, while spinning along at the rate of
eight or ten miles an hour. I saw them do it, often. There was no
danger about it; a sleeping man <i>will</i> seize the irons in time when the
coach jolts. These men were hard worked, and it was not possible
for them to stay awake all the time.</p>
<p>By and by we passed through Marysville, and over the Big Blue
and Little Sandy; thence about a mile, and entered Nebraska. About
a mile further on, we came to the Big Sandy&mdash;one hundred and
eighty miles from St. Joseph.</p>
<hr />
<p>As the sun went down and the evening chill came on, we made
preparation for bed. We stirred up the hard leather letter-sacks, and
the knotty canvas bags of printed matter (knotty and uneven because
of projecting ends and corners of magazines, boxes and books). We
stirred them up and redisposed them in such a way as to make our
bed as level as possible. And we <i>did</i> improve it, too, though after all
our work it had an upheaved and billowy look about it, like a little
piece of a stormy sea. Next we hunted up our boots from odd nooks
among the mail-bags where they had settled, and put them on. Then
we got down our coats, vests, pantaloons and heavy woolen shirts,
from the arm-loops where they had been swinging all day, and
clothed ourselves in them&mdash;for, there being no ladies either at the
stations or in the coach, and the weather being hot, we had looked
to our comfort by stripping to our under-clothing, at nine o&rsquo;clock in
the morning. All things being now ready, we stowed the uneasy
Dictionary where it would lie as quiet as possible, and placed the
water-canteens and pistols where we could find them in the dark.
Then we smoked a final pipe, and swapped a final yarn; after which,
we put the pipes, tobacco and bag of coin in snug holes and caves
among the mail-bags, and then fastened down the coach curtains all
around, and made the place as &ldquo;dark as the inside of a cow,&rdquo; as the
conductor phrased it in his picturesque way. It was certainly as dark
as any place could be&mdash;nothing was even dimly visible in it. And
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
finally, we rolled ourselves up like silk-worms, each person in his
own blanket, and sank peacefully to sleep.</p>
<p>Whenever the stage stopped to change horses, we would wake
up, and try to recollect where we were&mdash;and succeed&mdash;and in a
minute or two the stage would be off again, and we likewise. We began
to get into country, now, threaded here and there with little
streams. These had high, steep banks on each side, and every time
we flew down one bank and scrambled up the other, our party inside
got mixed somewhat. First we would all be down in a pile at the forward
end of the stage, nearly in a sitting posture, and in a second
we would shoot to the other end, and stand on our heads. And we
would sprawl and kick, too, and ward off ends and corners of mailbags
that came lumbering over us and about us; and as the dust rose
from the tumult, we would all sneeze in chorus, and the majority of
us would grumble, and probably say some hasty thing, like: &ldquo;Take
your elbow out of my ribs!&mdash;can&rsquo;t you quit crowding?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Every time we avalanched from one end of the stage to the
other, the Unabridged Dictionary would come too; and every time
it came it damaged somebody. One trip it &ldquo;barked&rdquo; the Secretary&rsquo;s
elbow; the next trip it hurt me in the stomach, and the third it tilted
Bemis&rsquo;s nose up till he could look down his nostrils&mdash;he said. The
pistols and coin soon settled to the bottom, but the pipes, pipe-stems,
tobacco and canteens clattered and floundered after the Dictionary
every time it made an assault on us, and aided and abetted the book
by spilling tobacco in our eyes, and water down our backs.</p>
<p>Still, all things considered, it was a very comfortable night. It
wore gradually away, and when at last a cold gray light was visible
through the puckers and chinks in the curtains, we yawned and
stretched with satisfaction, shed our cocoons, and felt that we had
slept as much as was necessary. By and by, as the sun rose up and
warmed the world, we pulled off our clothes and got ready for breakfast.
We were just pleasantly in time, for five minutes afterward the
driver sent the weird music of his bugle winding over the grassy solitudes,
and presently we detected a low hut or two in the distance.
Then the rattling of the coach, the clatter of our six horses&rsquo; hoofs, and
the driver&rsquo;s crisp commands, awoke to a louder and stronger emphasis,
and we went sweeping down on the station at our smartest speed.
<i>It was fascinating&mdash;that old Overland stagecoaching.</i></p>

<h2 id="c22">The Coming of the Railroad</h2>
<p>One of the dramatic events of American history took place at Promontory
Point, Utah, on May 10, 1869. On that day a golden spike was
driven into the last stretch of track, and for the first time the East and West
were linked by a railroad. After the spike-driving ceremony, the engineer of
the Central Pacific, which had started east from San Francisco, and the
engineer of the Union Pacific, which had been built west from the Mississippi,
ran their engines up until they touched. Then they shook hands and
broke champagne bottles over each other&rsquo;s locomotive. There were
speeches before and after, as gangs of Irish and Chinese laborers joined
governors, railroad dignitaries and other notables in celebrating the
momentous occasion.</p>
<h3 id="c23">Walt Whitman Writes of the Continental Railroad</h3>
<p>To Walt Whitman this event had a highly emotional significance. It
came in the same year that the Suez Canal was opened, and to Whitman
the two events marked a great step forward in the advance of civilization.
In his poem, &ldquo;A Passage to India,&rdquo; Whitman writes of the continental
railroad:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">I see over my own continent the Pacific railroad surmounting every barrier,</p>
<p class="t0">I see continual trains of cars winding along the Platte carrying freight and passengers,</p>
<p class="t0">I hear the locomotives rushing and roaring, and the shrill steam-whistle,</p>
<p class="t0">I hear the echoes reverberate through the grandest scenery in the world,</p>
<p class="t0">I cross the Laramie plains, I note the rocks in grotesque shapes, the buttes,</p>
<p class="t0">I see the plentiful larkspur and wild onions, the barren, colorless, sage-deserts,</p>
<p class="t0">I see in glimpses afar or towering immediately above me the great mountains, I see the Wind river and the Wahsatch mountains,</p>
<p class="t0">I see the Monument mountain and the Eagle&rsquo;s Nest, I pass the Promontory, I ascend the Nevadas,</p>
<p class="t0">I scan the noble Elk mountain and wind around its base,</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p class="t0">I see the Humboldt range, I thread the valley and cross the river,</p>
<p class="t0">I see the clear waters of lake Tahoe, I see forests of majestic pines,</p>
<p class="t0">Or crossing the great desert, the alkaline plains, I behold enchanting mirages of waters and meadows,</p>
<p class="t0">Marking through these and after all, in duplicate slender lines,</p>
<p class="t0">Bridging the three or four thousand miles of land travel,</p>
<p class="t0">Tying the Eastern to the Western sea,</p>
<p class="t0">The road between Europe and Asia.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="c24">Samuel Bowles Travels on the Union Pacific</h3>
<p>During the summer before the railroad was finished, the editor of the
Springfield, Massachusetts, <i>Republican</i>, Samuel Bowles, visited the West.
He traveled over the Union Pacific from Omaha, which he noted had become
a boom town since he had visited it last in 1865. He describes his
ride along the same route followed by the Oregon Trail and the Overland
Stage.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The day&rsquo;s ride grows monotonous. The road is as straight as an
arrow. Every dozen or fifteen miles is a station&mdash;two or three sheds,
and a waterspout and wood-pile; every one hundred miles or so a
home or a division depot, with shops, eating-house, &ldquo;saloons&rdquo; uncounted,
a store or two, a few cultivated acres, and the invariable
half-a-dozen seedy, staring loafers, that are a sort of fungi indigenous
to American railways. We yawn over the unchanging landscape and
the unvarying model of the stations, and lounge and read by day,
and go to bed early at night. But the clear, dry air charms; the half
dozen soldiers hurriedly marshalled into line at each station, as the
train comes up, suggest that the Indian question is not disposed of
yet; we catch a glimpse of antelopes in the distance; and we watch
the holes of the prairie dogs for their piquant little owners and their
traditional companions of owls and snakes&mdash;but never see the
snakes.</p>
<p>The Plains proper and the first day&rsquo;s ride end at Cheyenne, five
hundred and sixteen miles from Omaha. Here a branch road goes
off south a hundred miles to Denver, where it connects with the St.
Louis or Eastern Division of the Pacific road. Cheyenne is also a
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
great railroad work and supply shop, as becomes its location adjoining
the mountain and winter-exposed section of the road.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He continued on across Wyoming to the end of the line, which then was
crossing the high, arid tablelands near Rawlins. He saw the track laid over
the Continental Divide and marveled at the speed with which the job was
being accomplished. By the next May the construction crews had laid another
250 miles of track to complete the work.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Within this desert of the mountains, the divide of the continent
occurs both on the old stage road and the new Railroad line;
and here, in the summer of 1868, we witnessed the building of the
track over the parting of the waters. The last rail on the Atlantic
slope and the first on the Pacific were laid in our presence; and Governor
Bross pinned them down with stalwart blows upon their spikes.
As yet, still, no mountains appear in the path of the track, and it
winds easily along through these rolling sand-hills, occasionally
helped over a deep dry gulch, and spanning a feeble or possible river.
But the whole section is mountainously high, from seven thousand
to eight thousand feet above the sea level.</p>
<p>We witnessed here the fabulous speed with which the Railroad
was built. Through the two or three hundred miles beyond were
scattered ten to fifteen thousand men in great gangs preparing the
road bed; plows, scrapers, shovels, picks and carts; and, among the
rocks, drills and powder were doing the grading as rapidly as men
could stand and move with their tools. Long trains brought up to the
end of the completed track loads of ties and rails; the former were
transferred to teams, sent one or two miles ahead, and put in place
upon the grade. Then rails and spikes were reloaded on platform cars,
these pushed up to the last previously laid rail, and with an automatic
movement and a celerity that were wonderful, practiced hands
dropped the fresh rails one after another on the ties exactly in line,
huge sledges sent the spikes home, the car rolled on, and the operation
was repeated; while every few minutes the long heavy train behind
sent out a puff from its locomotive, and caught up with its load
of material the advancing work. The only limit, inside of eight miles
in twenty-four hours, to the rapidity with which the track could thus
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
be laid, was the power of the road behind to bring forward the
materials.</p>
<p>As the Railroad marched thus rapidly across the broad Continent
of plain and mountain, there was improvised a rough and temporary
town at its every public stopping-place. As this was changed every
thirty or forty days, these settlements were of the most perishable
materials&mdash;canvas tents, plain board shanties, and turf-hovels&mdash;pulled
down and sent forward for a new career, or deserted as worthless,
at every grand movement of the Railroad company. Only a small
proportion of their populations had aught to do with the road, or any
legitimate occupation. Most were the hangers-on around the disbursements
of such a gigantic work, catching the drippings from the
feast in any and every form that it was possible to reach them. Restaurant
and saloon keepers, gamblers, desperadoes of every grade,
the vilest of men and of women made up this &ldquo;Hell on Wheels,&rdquo; as it
was most aptly termed.</p>
<p>When we were on the line, this congregation of scum and wickedness
was within the Desert section, and was called Benton. One to
two thousand men, and a dozen or two women were encamped on
the alkali plain in tents and board shanties; not a tree, not a shrub,
not a blade of grass was visible; the dust ankle deep as we walked
through it, and so fine and volatile that the slightest breeze loaded
the air with it, irritating every sense and poisoning half of them; a
village of a few variety stores and shops, and many restaurants and
grog-shops; by day disgusting, by night dangerous; almost everybody
dirty, many filthy, and with the marks of lowest vice; averaging a
murder a day; gambling and drinking, hurdy-gurdy dancing and the
vilest of sexual commerce, the chief business and pastime of the hours&mdash;this
was Benton. Like its predecessors, it fairly festered in corruption,
disorder and death, and would have rotted, even in this dry air,
had it outlasted a brief sixty-day life. But in a few weeks its tents
were struck, its shanties razed, and with their dwellers moved on
fifty or a hundred miles farther to repeat their life for another brief
day. Where these people came from originally; where they went to
when the road was finished, and their occupation was over, were both
puzzles too intricate for me. Hell would appear to have been raked
to furnish them; and to it they must have naturally returned after
graduating here, fitted for its ... most diabolical service.</p>

<div class="img" id="fig3">
<img src="images/i03.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="650" />
<p class="caption">Gold mining in California</p>
</div>
<h2 id="c25">The Discovery of Gold</h2>
<p>Gold was discovered in January, 1848, on a ranch owned by John
Sutter on the American River in northern California. News of the find
spread like a prairie fire, and California, which had been a sparsely populated
land of cattle ranchers, became the Mecca of goldseekers. Everyone
who was lucky enough to be on the Pacific Coast rushed to the foothills
of the Sierras to hunt for gold, and as soon as the news reached the East
Coast, thousands of emigrants by land and by sea joined the gold rush.</p>
<p>In the years that followed the California gold rush, other rich deposits
of precious metals were found elsewhere in the West. The Comstock Lode
in Nevada produced a fabulous amount of silver, and later strikes in Colorado
made boom towns out of Denver, Cripple Creek, and Central City.
Still another gold rush after the Civil War took place in the Black Hills of
South Dakota.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>In the following selections we offer three glimpses of the rush for
precious metals. The first two recount gold-rush days in California; the third
deals with the silver bonanza in Nevada.</p>
<h3 id="c26">Walter Colton Describes the Effect of the Discovery</h3>
<p>The Reverend Walter Colton, a Congregational minister, arrived in
California in 1846 just after the Americans had taken possession of Monterey.
He was preaching and serving as alcalde (mayor) of Monterey at the
time gold was discovered. The following paragraphs come from his book,
<i>Three Years in California</i>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Monday, May 29, 1848</i>: Our town was startled out of its quiet
dreams today by the announcement that gold had been discovered on
the American Fork. The men wondered and talked, and the women
too; but neither believed....</p>
<p><i>Monday, June 12</i>: A straggler came in today from the American
Fork bringing a piece of yellow ore weighing an ounce.... But
doubts still hovered on the minds of the great mass. They could not
conceive that such a treasure could have lain there so long undiscovered....</p>
<p><i>Tuesday, June 20</i>: My messenger sent to the mines has returned
with specimens of the gold; he dismounted in a sea of upturned faces.
As he drew forth the yellow lumps from his pockets, and passed them
around among the eager crowd, the doubts, which had lingered till
now, fled. All admitted they were gold, except one old man, who still
persisted they were some Yankee invention, got up to reconcile the
people to the change of flag. The excitement produced was intense;
and many were soon busy in their hasty preparations for a departure
to the mines. The family who had kept house for me caught the moving
infection. Husband and wife were both packing up; the blacksmith
dropped his hammer, the carpenter his plane, the mason his
trowel, the farmer his sickle, the baker his loaf, and the tapster his
bottle. All were off for the mines, some on horses, some on carts,
and some on crutches, and one went in a litter. An American woman,
who had recently established a boarding-house here, pulled up stakes,
and was off before her lodgers had even time to pay their bills. Debtors
ran, of course. I have only a community of women left, and a
gang of prisoners, with here and there a soldier, who will give his
captain the slip at the first chance. I don&rsquo;t blame the fellow a whit;
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">37</span>
seven dollars a month, while others are making two or three hundred
a day! that is too much for human nature to stand.</p>
<p><i>Saturday, July 15</i>: The gold fever has reached every servant in
Monterey; none are to be trusted in their engagement beyond a week,
and as for compulsion, it is like attempting to drive fish into a net
with the ocean before them. Gen. Mason, Lieut. Lanman, and myself,
form a mess; we have a house, and all the table furniture and
culinary apparatus requisite; but our servants have run, one after
another, till we are almost in despair: even Sambo, who we thought
would stick by from laziness, if no other cause, ran last night; and
this morning, for the fortieth time, we had to take to the kitchen and
cook our own breakfast. A general of the United States Army, the
commander of a man-of-war, and the Alcalde of Monterey, in a
smoking kitchen, grinding coffee, toasting a herring, and peeling
onions!</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="c27">Eldorado</h3>
<p>When the news of the gold strike reached New York, Horace Greeley,
editor of the <i>Tribune</i>, sent a reporter, Bayard Taylor, to visit the mining
camps. Taylor, who later became a well-known poet and travel writer,
reached San Francisco by sea in August, 1849. On his way to the diggings
he passed through Stockton:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our first visit to Stockton was made in company, on some of
Major Graham&rsquo;s choicest horses. A mettled roan <i>canalo</i> fell to my
share, and the gallop of five miles without check was most inspiring.
A view of Stockton was something to be remembered. There, in the
heart of California, where the last winter stood a solitary ranch in the
midst of tule marshes, I found a canvas town of a thousand inhabitants,
and a port with twenty-five vessels at anchor! The mingled
noises of labor around&mdash;the click of hammers and the grating of
saws&mdash;the shouts of mule-drivers&mdash;the jingling of spurs&mdash;the jar and
jostle of wares in the tents&mdash;almost cheated me into the belief that it
was some old commercial mart, familiar with such sounds for years
past. Four months, only, had sufficed to make the place what it was;
and in that time a wholesale firm established there (one out of a
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
dozen) had done business to the amount of $100,000. The same
party had just purchased a lot of eighty by one hundred feet, on the
principal street, for $6,000, and the cost of erecting a common one-story
clapboard house on it was $15,000.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He continued by mule from Stockton to the diggings on the Mokelumne
River, some forty miles away. He was lodged in an open-air hotel which
consisted of two log tables, one for eating, the other for gambling. The
morning after arriving he inspected the mining operations:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I slept soundly that night on the dining-table, and went down
early to the river, where I found the party of ten bailing out the
water which had leaked into the riverbed during the night. They
were standing in the sun, and had two hours&rsquo; hard work before they
could begin to wash. Again the prospect looked uninviting, but when
I went there again towards noon, one of them was scraping up the
sand from the bed with his knife, and throwing it into a basin, the
bottom of which glittered with gold. Every knifeful brought out a
quantity of grains and scales, some of which were as large as the
fingernail. At last a two-ounce lump fell plump into the pan, and the
diggers, now in the best possible humor, went on with their work
with great alacrity. Their forenoon&rsquo;s digging amounted to nearly six
pounds [<i>an ounce of gold in California was then worth exactly
$16.00</i>]. It is only by such operations as these, through associated
labor, that great profits are to be made in those districts which have
been visited by the first eager horde of gold-hunters. The deposits
most easily reached are soon exhausted by the crowd, and the labor
required to carry on further work successfully deters single individuals
from attempting it. Those who, retaining their health, return
home disappointed say they have been humbugged about the gold,
when in fact they have humbugged themselves about the work. If
anyone expects to dig treasures out of the earth, in California, without
severe labor, he is woefully mistaken. Of all classes of men,
those who pave streets and quarry limestone are best adapted for
gold-diggers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the principal mining operators at the Mokelumne River site, Dr.
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">39</span>
Gillette, told Taylor how he and a companion struck it rich in a particular
gulch nearby:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One day at noon, while resting in the shade of a tree, Dr. G.
took a pick and began carelessly turning up the ground. Almost on
the surface, he struck and threw out a lump of gold of about two
pounds&rsquo; weight. Inspired by this unexpected result, they both went
to work, laboring all that day and the next, and even using part of
the night to quarry out the heavy pieces of rock. At the end of the
second day they went to the village on the Upper Bar and weighed
their profits, which amounted to fourteen pounds! They started
again the third morning under pretense of hunting, but were suspected
and followed by the other diggers, who came upon them just
as they commenced work. The news rapidly spread, and there was
soon a large number of men on the spot, some of whom obtained
several pounds per day, at the start. The gulch had been well dug
up for the large lumps, but there was still great wealth in the earth
and sand, and several operators only waited for the wet season to
work it in a systematic manner.</p>
<p>The next day Colonel Lyons, Dr. Gillette, and myself set out on
a visit to the scene of these rich discoveries. Climbing up the rocky
bottom of the gulch, as by a staircase, for four miles, we found
nearly every part of it dug up and turned over by the picks of the
miners. Deep holes, sunk between the solid strata or into the precipitous
sides of the mountains, showed where veins of the metal had
been struck and followed as long as they yielded lumps large enough
to pay for the labor. The loose earth, which they had excavated, was
full of fine gold, and only needed washing out. A number of Sonorians
were engaged in dry-washing this refuse sand&mdash;work which
requires no little skill, and would soon kill any other men than these
lank and skinny Arabs of the West. Their mode of work is as follows:
Gathering the loose dry sand in bowls, they raise it to their heads
and slowly pour it upon a blanket spread at their feet. Repeating
this several times, and throwing out the worthless pieces of rock,
they reduce the dust to about half its bulk; then, balancing the bowl
on one hand, by a quick, dexterous motion of the other they cause
it to revolve, at the same time throwing its contents into the air and
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
catching them as they fall. In this manner everything is finally winnowed
away except the heavier grains of sand mixed with gold,
which is carefully separated by the breath. It is a laborious occupation,
and one which, fortunately, the American diggers have not
attempted. This breathing the fine dust from day to day, under a
more than torrid sun, would soon impair the strongest lungs.</p>
<p>We found many persons at work in the higher part of the gulch,
searching for veins and pockets of gold, in the holes which had already
produced their first harvest. Some of these gleaners, following
the lodes abandoned by others as exhausted, into the sides of the
mountain, were well repaid for their perseverance. Others, again,
had been working for days without finding anything. Those who
understood the business obtained from one to four ounces daily.
Their only tools were the crowbar, pick, and knife, and many of
them, following the veins under strata of rock which lay deep below
the surface, were obliged to work while lying flat on their backs, in
cramped and narrow holes.</p>

<h3 id="c28">Mark Twain Doesn&rsquo;t Strike It Rich</h3>
<p>As Bayard Taylor suggests in the preceding narrative, not all fortune
seekers in the mining camps succeeded in finding gold or silver. Many
were unlucky or unwilling to work hard and returned home disillusioned.
Most of them stayed in California, however, and became farmers or city
workers. Thus the West Coast was settled before many states farther east.
Sam Clemens, who tried his hand at prospecting, was not a very serious
miner and found his gold when he turned his western experiences into
literary material, such as <i>Roughing It</i>, from which the next selection comes.
Here he tells how he almost got rich.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I confess, without shame, that I expected to find masses of
silver lying all about the ground. I expected to see it glittering in the
sun on the mountain summits. I said nothing about this, for some
instinct told me that I might possibly have an exaggerated idea about
it, and so if I betrayed my thought I might bring derision upon myself.
Yet I was as perfectly satisfied in my own mind as I could be
of anything, that I was going to gather up, in a day or two, or at
furthest a week or two, silver enough to make me satisfactorily
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">41</span>
wealthy&mdash;and so my fancy was already busy with plans for spending
this money. The first opportunity that offered, I sauntered carelessly
away from the cabin, keeping an eye on the other boys, and stopping
and contemplating the sky when they seemed to be observing me;
but as soon as the coast was manifestly clear, I fled away as guiltily
as a thief might have done and never halted till I was far beyond
sight and call.</p>
<p>Then I began my search with a feverish excitement that was
brimful of expectation&mdash;almost of certainty. I crawled about the
ground, seizing and examining bits of stone, blowing the dust from
them or rubbing them on my clothes, and then peering at them with
anxious hope. Presently I found a bright fragment and my heart
bounded! I hid behind a boulder and polished it and scrutinized it
with a nervous eagerness and a delight that was more pronounced
than absolute certainty itself could have afforded. The more I examined
the fragment the more I was convinced that I had found the
door to fortune. I marked the spot and carried away my specimen.
Up and down the rugged mountain side I searched, with always increasing
interest and always augmenting gratitude that I had come
to Humboldt and come in time. Of all the experiences of my life,
this secret search among the hidden treasures of silver-land was the
nearest to unmarred ecstasy. It was a delirious revel.</p>
<p>By and by, in the bed of a shallow rivulet, I found a deposit of
shining yellow scales, and my breath almost forsook me! A gold
mine, and in my simplicity I had been content with vulgar silver!
I was so excited that I half believed my overwrought imagination
was deceiving me. Then a fear came upon me that people might be
observing me and would guess my secret. Moved by this thought,
I made a circuit of the place, and ascended a knoll to reconnoiter.
Solitude. No creature was near. Then I returned to my mine, fortifying
myself against possible disappointment, but my fears were
groundless&mdash;the shining scales were still there. I set about scooping
them out, and for an hour I toiled down the windings of the stream
and robbed its bed. But at last the descending sun warned me to
give up the quest, and I turned homeward laden with wealth. As I
walked along I could not help smiling at the thought of my being
so excited over my fragment of silver when a nobler metal was
almost under my nose. In this little time the former had so fallen
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">42</span>
in my estimation that once or twice I was on the point of throwing
it away.</p>
<p>The boys were as hungry as usual, but I could eat nothing.
Neither could I talk. I was full of dreams and far away. Their conversation
interrupted the flow of my fancy somewhat, and annoyed
me a little, too. I despised the sordid and commonplace things they
talked about. But as they proceeded, it began to amuse me. It grew to
be rare fun to hear them planning their poor little economies and
sighing over possible privations and distresses when a gold mine, all
our own, lay within sight of the cabin and I could point it out at any
moment. Smothered hilarity began to oppress me, presently. It was
hard to resist the impulse to burst out with exultation and reveal
everything; but I did resist. I said within myself that I would filter
the great news through my lips calmly and be serene as a summer
morning while I watched its effect in their faces. I said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where have you all been?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Prospecting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you find?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing? What do you think of the country?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t tell, yet,&rdquo; said Mr. Ballou, who was an old gold miner,
and had likewise had considerable experience among the silver
mines.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, haven&rsquo;t you formed any sort of opinion?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, a sort of a one. It&rsquo;s fair enough here, maybe, but over-rated.
Seven-thousand-dollar ledges are scarce, though. That Sheba may
be rich enough, but we don&rsquo;t own it; and besides, the rock is so full
of base metals that all the science in the world can&rsquo;t work it. We&rsquo;ll
not starve, here, but we&rsquo;ll not get rich, I&rsquo;m afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you think the prospect is pretty poor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No name for it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;d better go back, hadn&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, not yet&mdash;of course not. We&rsquo;ll try it a riffle, first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose, now&mdash;this is merely a supposition, you know&mdash;suppose
you could find a ledge that would yield, say, a hundred and fifty
dollars a ton&mdash;would that satisfy you?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>&ldquo;Try us once!&rdquo; from the whole party.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or suppose&mdash;merely a supposition, of course&mdash;suppose you
were to find a ledge that would yield two thousand dollars a ton&mdash;would
<i>that</i> satisfy you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&mdash;what do you mean? What are you coming at? Is there
some mystery behind all this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind. I am not saying anything. You know perfectly
well there are no rich mines here&mdash;of course you do. Because you
have been around and examined for yourselves. Anybody would
know that, that had been around. But just for the sake of argument,
suppose&mdash;in a kind of general way&mdash;suppose some person were to
tell you that two-thousand-dollar ledges were simply contemptible&mdash;contemptible,
understand&mdash;and that right yonder in sight of this very
cabin there were piles of pure gold and pure silver&mdash;oceans of it&mdash;enough
to make you all rich in twenty-four hours! Come!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say he was as crazy as a loon!&rdquo; said old Ballou, but
wild with excitement, nevertheless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t say anything&mdash;<i>I</i> haven&rsquo;t been
around, you know, and of course don&rsquo;t know anything&mdash;but all I
ask of you is to cast your eye on <i>that</i>, for instance, and tell me what
you think of it!&rdquo; and I tossed my treasure before them.</p>
<p>There was an eager scramble for it, and a closing of heads together
over it under the candle-light. Then old Ballou said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think of it? I think it is nothing but a lot of granite rubbish and
nasty glittering mica that isn&rsquo;t worth ten cents an acre!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So vanished my dream. So melted my wealth away. So toppled
my airy castle to the earth and left me stricken and forlorn.</p>
<p>Moralizing, I observed, then, that &ldquo;all that glitters is not gold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Ballou said that I could go further than that, and lay it up
among my treasures of knowledge, that <i>nothing</i> that glitters is gold.
So I learned then, once for all, that gold in its native state is but dull,
unornamental stuff, and that only lowborn metals excite the admiration
of the ignorant with an ostentatious glitter. However, like
the rest of the world, I still go on underrating men of gold and glorifying
men of mica. Commonplace human nature cannot rise above
that.</p>

<p class="caption">Texas cattle being driven to the cattle rendezvous</p>
</div>
<h2 id="c29">The Long Drive</h2>
<p>Before the Texans won independence from Mexico, stocks of Spanish
cattle owned by Mexicans ranged the plains of southern Texas. Then the
Mexicans were driven out, and their cattle ran wild. By the time of the
Civil War, herds of wild longhorns roamed the Texas ranges. As the population
of the United States grew and the railroads pushed into the trans-Mississippi
region, the cattle industry became big business. Texas ranchers
began rounding up the wild cattle and driving them to market over various
trails, the best known of which probably is the Chisholm Trail. Ranching
soon spread to other western states clear to the Canadian border. The
decades following the Civil War were the golden age of the cowboy.</p>
<h3 id="c30">Andy Adams Encounters Rustlers</h3>
<p>Andy Adams, who was born in Georgia of Scotch-Irish parents, moved
to Texas after the Civil War. He grew up in the cattle country and naturally
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">45</span>
drifted into cow-punching as a career. When he was in his early twenties,
he joined a long cattle drive from Texas to Montana under the leadership
of a foreman named Jim Flood. The expedition, which he describes vividly
in <i>The Log of a Cowboy</i>, began along the Rio Grande River in Texas in
April, 1882. Six men rode on either side of a long cow column that
stretched out over three quarters of a mile of crooked trail. The main problem
until the herd reached the Colorado River in central Texas was to find
watering places, but as the animals approached the river, the cowboys
learned that rustlers were active in that area. Their chief worry was that
the rustlers would sneak into their midst at night, stampede the cattle, and
then drive off part of the herd under cover of darkness.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We camped that night some five or six miles back from the river
on the last divide. From the time the second guard went on until
the third was relieved, we took the precaution of keeping a scout outriding
from a half to three quarters of a mile distant from the herd,
Flood and Honeyman serving in that capacity. Every precaution
was taken to prevent a surprise; and in case anything did happen,
our night horses tied to the wagon wheels stood ready and saddled
and bridled for any emergency. But the night passed without incident.</p>
<p>An hour or two after the herd had started the next morning,
four well-mounted, strange men rode up from the westward, and
representing themselves as trail cutters, asked for our foreman. Flood
met them, in his usual quiet manner, and after admitting that we had
been troubled more or less with range cattle, assured our callers that
if there was anything in the herd in the brands they represented, he
would gladly hold it up and give them every opportunity to cut their
cattle out. As he was anxious to cross the river before noon, he invited
the visitors to stay for dinner, assuring them that before starting
the herd in the afternoon, he would throw the cattle together for
their inspection. Flood made himself very agreeable, inquiring into
cattle and range matters in general as well as the stage of water in
the river ahead. The spokesman of the trail cutters met Flood&rsquo;s invitation
to dinner with excuses about the pressing demands on his
time, and urged, if it did not seriously interfere with our plans, that
he be allowed to inspect the herd before crossing the river. His reasons
seemed trivial and our foreman was not convinced.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>&ldquo;You see, gentlemen,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;in handling these southern cattle,
we must take advantage of occasions. We have timed our morning&rsquo;s
drive so as to reach the river during the warmest hour of the
day, or as near noon as possible. You can hardly imagine what a
difference there is, in fording this herd, between a cool, cloudy day
and a clear, hot one. You see the herd is strung out nearly a mile in
length now, and to hold them up and waste an hour or more for your
inspection would seriously disturb our plans. And then our wagon
and <i>remuda</i> [<i>spare horses</i>] have gone on with orders to noon at the
first good camp beyond the river. I perfectly understand your reasons,
and you equally understand mine; but I will send a man or two
back to help you recross any cattle you may find in our herd. Now,
if a couple of you gentlemen will ride around on the far side with
me, and the others will ride up near the lead, we will trail the
cattle across when we reach the river without cutting the herd into
blocks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Flood&rsquo;s affability, coupled with the fact that the lead cattle were
nearly up to the river, won his point. Our visitors could only yield,
and rode forward with our lead swing men to assist in forcing the
lead cattle into the river. It was swift water, but otherwise an easy
crossing, and we allowed the herd, after coming out on the farther
side, to spread out and graze forward at its pleasure. The wagon
and saddle stock were in sight about a mile ahead, and leaving two
men on herd to drift the cattle in the right direction, the rest of us
rode leisurely on to the wagon, where dinner was waiting. Flood
treated our callers with marked courtesy during dinner, and casually
inquired if any of their number had seen any cattle that day or the
day previous in the Ellison road brand. They had not, they said,
explaining that their range lay on both sides of the Concho, and that
during the trail season they kept all their cattle between that river
and the main Colorado. Their work had kept them on their own
range recently, except when trail herds were passing and needed to
be looked through for strays. It sounded as though our trail cutters
could also use diplomacy on occasion.</p>
<p>When dinner was over and we had caught horses for the afternoon
and were ready to mount, Flood asked our guests for their credentials
as duly authorized trail cutters. They replied that they had
none, but offered in explanation the statement that they were merely
<span class="pb" id="Page_47">47</span>
cutting in the interest of the immediate locality, which required no
written authority.</p>
<p>Then the previous affability of our foreman turned into iron.
&ldquo;Well, men,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;if you have no authority to cut this trail, then
you don&rsquo;t cut this herd. I must have inspection papers before I can
move a brand out of the county in which it is bred, and I&rsquo;ll certainly
let no other man, local or duly appointed, cut an animal out of this
herd without written and certified authority. You know that without
being told, or ought to. I respect the rights of every man posted on a
trail to cut it. If you want to see my inspection papers, you have a
right to demand them, and in turn I demand of you your credentials,
showing who you work for and the list of brands you represent;
otherwise no harm&rsquo;s done; nor do you cut any herd that I&rsquo;m driving.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said one of the men, &ldquo;I saw a couple of head in my own
individual brand as we rode up the herd. I&rsquo;d like to see the man who
says that I haven&rsquo;t the right to claim my own brand, anywhere I
find it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If there&rsquo;s anything in our herd in your individual brand,&rdquo; said
Flood, &ldquo;all you have to do is to give me the brand, and I&rsquo;ll cut it
for you. What&rsquo;s your brand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The &lsquo;Window Sash.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have any of you boys seen such a brand in our herd?&rdquo; inquired
Flood, turning to us as we all stood by our horses ready to start.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The strangers, who actually were rustlers, had hoped to bluff Flood
out of some cattle. All herds traveling across unfenced range managed to
pick up strays from time to time. When Flood would not let the men get
away with their trick, they fell back on claiming cows with the &ldquo;Window
Sash&rdquo; brand. Three such animals had found their way into the big herd as
it moved north. After the rustlers angrily drove off their trio of scrawny
cows, Flood met some Texas Rangers under the command of Corporal
Homes. They laid a trap for the rustlers, who had threatened to return.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hames at once assumed charge of the herd, Flood gladly rendering
every assistance possible. We night herded as usual, but
during the two middle guards, Hames sent out four of his Rangers
<span class="pb" id="Page_48">48</span>
to scout the immediate outlying country, though, as we expected,
they met with no adventure. At daybreak the Rangers threw their
packs into our wagon and their loose stock into our <i>remuda</i>, and
riding up the trail a mile or more, left us, keeping well out of sight.
We were all hopeful now that the trail cutters of the day before
would make good their word and return. In this hope we killed time
for several hours that morning, grazing the cattle and holding the
wagon in the rear. Sending the wagon ahead of the herd had been
agreed on as the signal between our foreman and the Ranger corporal,
at first sight of any posse behind us. We were beginning to
despair of their coming, when a dust cloud appeared several miles
back down the trail. We at once hurried the wagon and <i>remuda</i>
ahead to warn the Rangers, and allowed the cattle to string out
nearly a mile in length.</p>
<p>A fortunate rise in the trail gave us a glimpse of the cavalcade
in our rear, which was entirely too large to be any portion of Straw&rsquo;s
[<i>foreman of a herd that the rustlers had stampeded earlier</i>] outfit;
and shortly we were overtaken by our trail cutters of the day
before, now increased to twenty-two mounted men. Flood was intentionally
in the lead of the herd, and the entire outfit galloped
forward to stop the cattle. When they had nearly reached the lead,
Flood turned back and met the rustlers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m as good as my word,&rdquo; said the leader, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m here
to trim your herd as I promised you I would. Throw off and hold up
your cattle, or I&rsquo;ll do it for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Several of our outfit rode up at this juncture in time to hear
Flood&rsquo;s reply: &ldquo;If you think you&rsquo;re equal to the occasion, hold them
up yourself. If I had as big an outfit as you have, I wouldn&rsquo;t ask any
man to help me. I want to watch a Colorado River outfit work a herd&mdash;I
might learn something. My outfit will take a rest, or perhaps
hold the cut or otherwise clerk for you. But be careful and don&rsquo;t
claim anything that you are not certain is your own, for I reserve
the right to look over your cut before you drive it away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The rustlers rode in a body to the lead, and when they had
thrown the herd off the trail, about half of them rode back and
drifted towards the rear cattle. Flood called our outfit to one side
and gave us our instructions, the herd being entirely turned over to
the rustlers. After they began cutting, we rode around and pretended
<span class="pb" id="Page_49">49</span>
to assist in holding the cut as the strays in our herd were being cut
out.... Not a man of us even cast a glance up the trail, or in the
direction of the Rangers; but when the work was over, Flood protested
with the leader of the rustlers over some five or six head of
dim-branded cattle which actually belonged to our herd. But he was
exultant and would listen to no protests, and attempted to drive
away the cut, now numbering nearly fifty head. Then we rode across
their front and stopped them. In the parley which ensued, harsh
words were passing, when one of our outfit blurted out in well-feigned
surprise&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, who&rsquo;s that, coming over there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A squad of men were riding leisurely through our abandoned
herd, coming over to where the two outfits were disputing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the trouble here, gents?&rdquo; inquired Hames as he rode up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you and what might be your business, may I ask?&rdquo;
inquired the leader of the rustlers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Personally I&rsquo;m nobody, but officially I&rsquo;m Corporal in Company
B, Texas Rangers&mdash;well, if there isn&rsquo;t smiling Ed Winters, the biggest
cattle thief ever born in Medina County. Why, I&rsquo;ve got papers
for you; for altering the brands on over fifty head of &lsquo;C&rsquo; cattle into a
&lsquo;G&rsquo; brand. Come here, dear, and give me that gun of yours. Come
on, and no false moves or funny work or I&rsquo;ll shoot the white out of
your eye. Surround this layout, lads, and let&rsquo;s examine them more
closely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this command, every man in our outfit whipped out his six-shooter,
the Rangers leveled their carbines on the rustlers, and in
less than a minute&rsquo;s time they were disarmed and as crestfallen a
group of men as ever walked into a trap of their own setting. Hames
got out a &ldquo;black book,&rdquo; and after looking the crowd over concluded
to hold the entire covey, as the descriptions of the &ldquo;wanted&rdquo; seemed
to include most of them. Some of the rustlers attempted to explain
their presence, but Hames decided to hold the entire party, &ldquo;just to
learn them to be more careful of their company the next time,&rdquo; as
he put it.</p>

<p class="caption">Plowing on the prairies west of the Mississippi</p>

<h2 id="c31">Homesteading in the Dakotas</h2>
<p>The last frontier to fall before the westward march of civilization was
that of the farmer. Farmers were beginning to plow the virgin prairie soil
even before the Civil War, but after the conflict the line of farming communities
in Nebraska, Kansas, and the Dakotas began to move relentlessly
westward. The railroads were given large tracts of public land which they
sold to settlers. Many Civil War veterans took up free land after their discharge,
as provided for in the Homestead Act of 1862. The following
selections illustrate the farming frontier on the plains.</p>
<h3 id="c32">O. E. R&ouml;lvaag Pictures the Norwegian Settlers</h3>
<p>O. E. R&ouml;lvaag, the author of the following selection, grew up in a
Norwegian fishing village, but at the age of twenty he emigrated to
America and worked for his uncle on a Dakota farm. Later he worked his
way through St. Olaf College and eventually became a professor of Norwegian
literature at his alma mater. His excellent novel, <i>Giants in the
Earth</i>, from which the following pages are taken, describes the life of Norwegian
<span class="pb" id="Page_51">51</span>
farmers in the Dakota Territory. As the novel opens, several
Norwegian families are taking up homesteads. Before they make their first
crops and can afford real houses, they have to live in sod houses, which
are really cellars dug in the prairie and roofed over with sod.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On the side of a hill, which sloped gently away toward the southeast
and followed with many windings a creek that wormed its way
across the prairie, stood Hans Olsa, laying turf. He was building a
sod house. The walls had now risen breast-high; in its half-finished
condition, the structure resembled more a bulwark against some
enemy than anything intended to be a human habitation. And the
great heaps of cut sod, piled up in each corner, might well have been
the stores of ammunition for defense of the stronghold.</p>
<p>For a man of his strength and massive build, his motions were
unusually quick and agile; but he worked by fits and starts today.
At times he stopped altogether; in these pauses he would straighten
himself up and draw his sleeve with a quick stroke across his troubled
face; with each stroke the sleeve would come away damper; and
standing so, he would fix his gaze intently on the prairie to the eastward.
His eyes had wandered so often now over the stretch of land
lying before them, that they were familiar with every tussock and
hollow.... [<i>The spaced periods in this selection do not indicate
omitted material but are the author&rsquo;s own punctuation.</i>] No&mdash;nothing
in sight yet!... He would resume his task, as if to make up for
lost time, and work hard for a spell; only to forget himself once more,
pause involuntarily, and stand inert and abstracted, gazing off into
the distance.</p>
<p>Beyond the house a tent had been pitched; a wagon was drawn
up close beside it. On the ground outside of the tent stood a stove,
a couple of chairs, and a few other rough articles of furniture. A
stout, healthy-looking woman, whose face radiated an air of simple
wisdom and kindliness, was busy preparing the midday meal. She
sang to herself as she worked. A ten-year-old girl, addressed by the
woman as Sofie, was helping her. Now and then the girl would take
up the tune and join in the singing.</p>
<p>Less than a quarter of a mile away, in a southeasterly direction,
a finished sod house rose on the slope of the hill. Smoke was winding
<span class="pb" id="Page_52">52</span>
up from it at this moment. This house, which had been built the
previous fall, belonged to Syvert T&ouml;nseten.</p>
<p>Some distance north from the place where Hans Olsa had located,
two other sod houses were under construction; but a hillock
lay between, so that he could not see them from where he stood.
There the two Solum boys had driven down their stakes and had
begun building. T&ouml;nseten&rsquo;s completed house, and the other three
half-finished ones, marked the beginning of the settlement on Spring
Creek.</p>
<p>The woman who had been bustling about preparing the meal,
now called to her husband that dinner was ready&mdash;he must come at
once! He answered her, straightened up for the hundredth time,
wiped his hands on his trousers, and stood for a moment gazing off
eastward.... No use to look&mdash;not a soul in sight yet!... He sighed
heavily, and walked with slow steps toward the tent, his eyes on
the ground.</p>
<p>It was light and airy inside the tent, but stifling hot, because of
the unobstructed sunlight beating down upon it. Two beds were
ranged along the wall, both of them homemade; a big emigrant chest
stood at the head of each. Nails had been driven into the centre pole
of the tent, on which hung clothing; higher up a crosspiece, securely
fastened, was likewise hung with clothes. Two of the walls were lined
with furniture; on these pieces the dishes were displayed, all neatly
arranged.</p>
<p>A large basin of water stood on a chair just inside the tent door.
Hans Olsa washed his face and hands; then he came out and sat
down on the ground, where his wife had spread the table. It was so
much cooler outside. The meal was all ready; both mother and
daughter had been waiting for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you haven&rsquo;t seen any signs of them yet?&rdquo; his wife
asked at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;nothing at all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you imagine what has become of them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Lord forgive us&mdash;if I only knew!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They are waiting for Per Hansa and his family, whose wagon broke
down, to reach the homestead site. The Hansas arrive soon, and the next
<span class="pb" id="Page_53">53</span>
selection describes them the day after, as the father goes to town to register
his claim and the mother wonders fearfully what the future holds for
them on the empty, lonely prairie.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Early the next morning Per Hansa and one of the Solum boys
set out on the fifty-two mile journey to Sioux Falls, where Per Hansa
filed an application for the quarter-section of land which lay to the
north of Hans Olsa&rsquo;s. To confirm the application, he received a temporary
deed to the land. The deed was made out in the name of
<i>Peder Benjamin Hansen</i>; it contained a description of the land, the
conditions which he agreed to fulfil in order to become the owner,
and the date, <i>June 6, 1873</i>.</p>
<p>S&ouml;rine [<i>Hans Olsa&rsquo;s wife</i>] wanted Beret and the children to stay
with her during the two days that her husband would be away; but
she refused the offer with thanks. If they were to get ready a home
for the summer, she said, she would have to take hold of matters
right away.</p>
<p>... &ldquo;For the summer?&rdquo; exclaimed the other woman, showing her
astonishment. &ldquo;What about the winter, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Beret saw that she had uttered a thought which she ought to have
kept to herself; she evaded the question as best she could.</p>
<p>During the first day, both she and the boys found so much to
do that they hardly took time to eat. They unloaded both wagons,
set up the stove, and carried out the table. Then Beret arranged their
bedroom in the larger wagon. With all the things taken out it was
quite roomy in there; it made a tidy bedroom when everything had
been put in order. The boys thought this work great fun, and she
herself found some relief in it for her troubled mind. But something
vague and intangible hovering in the air would not allow her to be
wholly at ease; she had to stop often and look about, or stand erect
and listen.... Was that a sound she heard? ... All the while, the
thought that had struck her yesterday when she had first got down
from the wagon, stood vividly before her mind: here there was
nothing even to hide behind!... When the room was finished, and
a blanket had been hung up to serve as a door, she seemed a little
less conscious of this feeling. But back in the recesses of her mind
it still was there....</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>After they had milked the cow, eaten their evening porridge, and
talked awhile to the oxen, she took the boys and And-Ongen and
strolled away from camp. With a common impulse, they went toward
the hill; when they had reached the summit, Beret sat down
and let her gaze wander aimlessly around.... In a certain sense,
she had to admit to herself, it was lovely up here. The broad expanse
stretching away endlessly in every direction, seemed almost like the
ocean&mdash;especially now, when darkness was falling. It reminded her
strongly of the sea, and yet it was very different.</p>
<p>... This formless prairie had no heart that beat, no waves that
sang, no soul that could be touched ... or cared....</p>
<p>The infinitude surrounding her on every hand might not have
been so oppressive, might even have brought her a measure of peace,
if it had not been for the deep silence, which lay heavier here than
in a church. Indeed, what was there to break it? She had passed beyond
the outposts of civilization; the nearest dwelling places of men
were far away. Here no warbling of birds rose on the air, no buzzing
of insects sounded; even the wind had died away; the waving blades
of grass that trembled to the faintest breath now stood erect and
quiet, as if listening, in the great hush of the evening.... All along
the way, coming out, she had noticed this strange thing: the stillness
had grown deeper, the silence more depressing, the farther west they
journeyed; it must have been over two weeks now since she had
heard a bird sing! Had they travelled into some nameless, abandoned
region? Could no living thing exist out here, in the empty, desolate,
endless wastes of green and blue?... How <i>could</i> existence go on,
she thought, desperately? If life is to thrive and endure, it must at
least have something to hide behind!...</p>
<p>The children were playing boisterously a little way off. What a
terrible noise they made! But she had better let them keep on with
their play, as long as they were happy.... She sat perfectly quiet,
thinking of the long, oh, so interminably long march that they would
have to make, back to the place where human beings dwelt. It would
be small hardship for her, of course, sitting in the wagon; but she
pitied Per Hansa and the boys&mdash;and then the poor oxen!... He certainly
would soon find out for himself that a home for men and
women and children could never be established in this wilderness....
And how could she bring new life into the world out here!...</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>Slowly her thoughts began to centre on her husband; they grew
warm and tender as they dwelt on him. She trembled as they
came....</p>
<p>But only for a brief while. As her eyes darted nervously here and
there, flitting from object to object and trying to pierce the purple
dimness that was steadily closing in, a sense of desolation so profound
settled upon her that she seemed unable to think at all. It
would not do to gaze any longer at the terror out there, where everything
was turning to grim and awful darkness.... She threw herself
back in the grass and looked up into the heavens. But darkness and
infinitude  lay there, also&mdash;the sense of utter desolation still remained....
Suddenly, for the first time, she realized the full extent of her
loneliness, the dreadful nature of the fate that had overtaken her.
Lying there on her back, and staring up into the quiet sky across
which the shadows of night were imperceptibly creeping, she went
over in her mind every step of their wanderings, every mile of the
distance they had travelled since they had left home.</p>

<h2 id="c33">The Land Rush in Oklahoma</h2>
<p>The history of Oklahoma contains two of the most fascinating episodes
in the Westward Movement. These were the land rushes of 1889 and 1893,
when the government threw open several million acres of land to settlers
on a first-come, first-served basis. The opening of these tracts came at a
time when choice land throughout the plains states already had been taken
up, and because the openings were well publicized throughout the country,
the competition for farms and town lots was tremendous. In the following
report Hamilton Wicks describes the boom psychology and his own part
in the race for free land in 1889. Guthrie, Oklahoma, where Wicks claimed
a town lot, was on the route of the Henry Ellsworth and Washington
Irving expedition in 1832.</p>
<h3 id="c34">Hamilton Wicks Races to Guthrie</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>And now the hour of twelve was at hand, and every one on the
<i>qui vive</i> for the bugle blast that would dissolve the chain of enchantment
hitherto girding about this coveted land. Many of the
&ldquo;boomers&rdquo; were mounted on high-spirited and fleet-footed horses,
and had ranged themselves along the territorial line, scarcely restrained
<span class="pb" id="Page_56">56</span>
even by the presence of the troops of cavalry from taking
summary possession. The better class of wagons and carriages ranged
themselves in line with the horsemen, and even here and there mule
teams attached to canvas-covered vehicles stood in the front ranks,
with the reins and whip grasped by the &ldquo;boomers&rsquo;&rdquo; wives. All was
excitement and expectation. Every nerve was on tension and every
muscle strained.</p>
<p>Suddenly the air was pierced with the blast of a bugle. Hundreds
of throats echoed the sound with shouts of exultation. The quivering
limbs of saddled steeds, no longer restrained by the hands that held
their bridles, bounded forward, simultaneously into the &ldquo;beautiful
land&rdquo; of Oklahoma; and wagons and carriages and buggies and
prairie schooners and a whole congregation of curious equipages
joined in this unparalleled race, where every starter was bound to
win a prize&mdash;the &ldquo;Realization Stakes&rdquo; of home and prosperity.</p>
<p>We, the spectators, witnessed the spectacle with most intense interest.
Away dashed the thoroughbreds, the bronchos, the pintos, and
the mustangs at a breakneck pace, across the uneven surface of the
prairie. It was amazing to witness the recklessness of those cowboy
riders. They jumped obstacles. They leaped ditches. They cantered
with no diminution of speed through waterpools; and when they
came to a ravine too wide to leap, down they would go with a rush,
and up the other side with a spurt of energy, to scurry once more
like mad over the level plain.</p>
<p>The occupants of our train now became absorbed in their own
fate.... It was rather hard pulling for our engine until we reached
the apex of the Cimarron Valley, spread out in picturesque beauty
at our very feet. Our train now rushed along the downgrade with the
speed of a limited express crossing the fine bridge that spans the
Cimarron with a roar, and swinging around the hills that intervened
between the river and the Guthrie town site with the rapidity of a
swallow&rsquo;s flight. All that there was of Guthrie, the now famous
&ldquo;magic city,&rdquo; on April 22, at 1:30 <span class="small">P.M.</span>, when the first train from
the north drew up at the station and unloaded its first instalment of
settlers, was a water-tank, a small station-house, a shanty for the
Wells Fargo Express, and a Government Land Office.</p>
<p>I remember throwing my blankets out of the car window the
instant the train stopped at the station. I remember tumbling after
<span class="pb" id="Page_57">57</span>
them through the self-same window. Then I joined the wild scramble
for a town lot up the sloping hillside at a pace discounting any &ldquo;go-as-you-please&rdquo;
race. There were several thousand people converging
on the same plot of ground, each eager for a town lot which was to
be acquired without cost and without price, each solely dependent
on his own efforts, and animated by a spirit of fair play and good
humor. The race was not over when you reached the particular lot
you were content to select for your possession. The contest still was
who should drive their stakes first, who would erect their tents
soonest, and then, who would quickest build a little wooden shanty.
It reminded me of playing blind-man&rsquo;s bluff. One did not know how
far to go before stopping. It was hard to tell when it was best to stop;
and it was a puzzle whether to turn to the right hand or the left.</p>
<p>I found myself, without exactly knowing why, about midway
between the government building and depot. It occurred to me that
a street would probably run past the depot. I accosted a man who
looked like a deputy, with a piece of white card in his hands, and
asked if this was to be a street along here.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;We are laying off four corner lots right here
for a lumber yard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this the corner where I stand?&rdquo; I inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he responded, approaching me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I claim this corner lot!&rdquo; I said with decision, as I jammed
my location stick in the ground and hammered it securely home with
my heel....</p>
<p>An angry altercation [<i>argument</i>] ensued, but I stoutly maintained
my position and my rights. I proceeded at once to unstrap a
small folding-cot I brought with me, and by standing it on its end
made a tolerable center-pole for a tent. I then threw a couple of my
blankets over the pole, and staked them securely into the ground on
either side. Thus I had a claim that was unjumpable because of substantial
improvements.</p>
<p>As night approached I strolled up on the eminence near the land
office, and surveyed the wonderful cyclorama spread out before me
on all sides. Ten thousand people had &ldquo;squatted&rdquo; upon a square mile
of virgin prairie that first afternoon, and as the myriad of white
tents suddenly appeared upon the face of the country, it was as
<span class="pb" id="Page_58">58</span>
though a vast flock of huge white-winged birds had just settled down
upon the hillsides and in valleys. Here indeed was <i>a city laid out
and populated in half a day</i>. Thousands of campfires sparkled upon
the dark bosom of the prairie as far as the eye could reach.</p>
<p>I will never forget the first night of occupancy of this army. Unlike
the hosts of the Assyrians that descended on the Israelites, their
tents were not silent. On the contrary, there was a fusilade of shots
on all sides from Winchesters, and Colts, and Remingtons, disturbing
the stillness of the night, mingled with halloos, and shoutings,
and the rebel yell, and the imitated warwhoop of the savage. I expected
on the morrow to see the prairie strewn with gory corpses,
but not a single corpse appeared, and I was not slow in making up
my mind that nine-tenths of all the shots were fired in a mere wanton
spirit of bravado to intimidate a few such nervous tenderfeet as
myself.</p>
<p>I was witness of all this magical municipal development, and
could scarcely realize the miracle that was unfolding before me. The
wealth-creating force that was displayed in the building up of
Guthrie can not be better illustrated than in the fact that lots which
had no value prior to April 22 sold in the center of the business
district as high as five hundred dollars within a week thereafter, and
a number changed hands before the expiration of the first month
for one thousand, five hundred dollars each.</p>
